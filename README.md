# Bibliometric analysis of recommender systems
 
This is the code used in the paper 'A survey on Neural Recommender Systems:
insights from a bibliographic analysis' (link will be provided when available). In order 
to run the code, you need to install the libraries in the file `requirements.txt` in 
your virtual environment:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The results will be saved in the `data` directory. In the same directory you will also 
find the data that we used to perform the analysis.

## How to run the script

In order to run the script you need to just run the `main.py` script in your environment 
or wherever you wish to run it. For instance, in the directory where is the script:

`python main.py`

Or if you are using `pipenv`:

`pipenv run main.py`
