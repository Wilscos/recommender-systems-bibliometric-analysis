We recently discovered this species in space toward the same source at a wavelength of λ 8 mm. In those observations, various hyperﬁne components of the 2-1rotational transition, at 37.5 GHz, were detected using the Yebes 40m telescope. Here, we used the IRAM 30m telescope to detect ten hyperﬁne components of the 5 frequencies diﬀer by 0.2 MHz with respect to the predictions from available laboratory data. This diﬀerence is signiﬁcant for a radioastronomical search for CHCCH in interstellar sources with narrow lines. We thus included the measured frequencies in a new spectroscopic analysis to provide accurate frequency predictions for the interstellar search for propargyl at mm wavelengths. Moreover, we recommend that future searches for CHCCH in cold interstellar clouds are carried out at λ 3 mm, rather than at λ 8 mm. The 5-4transition is about ﬁve times more intense than the 2 requires about seven times less telescope time than detecting the latter. We constrain the rotational temperature of CH to 9.9 ± 1.5 K, which indicates that the rotational levels of this species are thermalized at the gas kinetic temperature. The revised value of the column density of CHCCH (including ortho and para species) is (1.0 ±0.2) ×10 abundance ratio is revised from slightly below one to nearly one. This study opens the door for future detections of CH cold interstellar clouds, making possible to further investigate the role of this very abundant hydrocarbon radical in the synthesis of large organic molecules such as aromatic rings. The on going line surveys of the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC-1) at the Green Bank telescope (GOTHAM; McGuire et al. 2020) and at the Yebes 40m telescope (QUIJOTE; Cernicharo et al. 2021d), are demonstrating that complex hydrocarbons, including cyclic and polycyclic aromatic ones, are formed in situ in cold dense clouds. Examples of such molecules detected toward TMC-1 are propylene (CHCHCH), vinyl and allenyl acetylene (CHCHCCH and CHCCHCCH), cyclopentadiene (c-CH), indene (c-CH), and benzyne (o-CH) (Marcelino et al. 2007; Cernicharo et al. 2021a,b,c,d; Burkhardt et al. 2021). Moreover, ethyl acetylene (CHCHCCH) and ethynyl benzene (c-CHCCH) have been tentatively detected (Cernicharo et al. 2021a,e), and there is strong evidence for the presence of aromatic rings such as benzene and naphthalene from the detection of their CN derivatives (McGuire et al. 2018, 2021; Cernicharo et al. 2021e). It is not yet well understood which chemical routes are behind the formation of these aromatic cycles in cold dark clouds like TMC-1. Hydrocarbon radicals are likely key players in the synthesis of these large molecules from smaller species. How- Based on observations carried out with the Yebes 40m telescope (projects 19A003, 20A014, 20D023, and 21A011) and the IRAM 30m telescope. The 40m radiotelescope at Yebes Observatory is operated by the Spanish Geographic Institute (IGN, Ministerio de Transportes, Movilidad y Agenda Urbana). IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany) and IGN (Spain). -1one in TMC-1, which implies that detecting the former ever, only a few such radicals have been detected. The methylidyne radical CH and the polyacetylenic radicals CH, CH, CH, and even longer ones are known from long time ago. Other radicals such as CH, CH, or CHare likely important pieces in the synthesis of large hydrocarbons but detecting them has been proven to be diﬃcult due to diﬀerent possible reasons like spectral dilution due to splitting of rotational lines into numerous ﬁne and hyperﬁne components, low abundance, low dipole moment, or lack of suﬃciently sensitive radioastronomical observations. We recently identiﬁed the propargyl radical (CHCCH) toward TMC-1 as part of the QUIJOTE line survey (Agúndez et al. 2021a). It was found that CHCCH is one of the most abundant radicals in TMC-1, being present at the level of its closedshell counterpart CHCCH. Being that abundant, the propargyl radical becomes a very attractive candidate to play an important role in the synthesis of aromatic molecules. For example, calculations indicate that the propargyl radical self reaction can lead to cyclization producing the aromatic radical phenyl radical at low temperatures (Miller & Klippenstein 2001; Zhao et al. 2021). The radical CHCCH was detected in TMC-1 at λ 8 mm through six hyperﬁne components belonging to the 2-1rotational transition. Here we report the detection of CHCCH toward TMC-1 at λ 3 mm. We observed the 5-4transition in ten hyperﬁne components, with frequencies that diﬀer by 0.2 MHz from previous available predictions. We thus used the observed frequencies to improve the spectroscopic parameters of CHCCH and provide accurate predictions to guide future astronomical searches. Moreover, the λ 3 mm line is about ﬁve times Fig. 1. Observed spectra of TMC-1 around the 2-1and 5-4rotational transitions of ortho CH with the Yebes 40m telescope (black histogram in bottom panel) and that at 93.6 GHz is taken with the IRAM 30m telescope (black histogram in top panel). Transition quantum numbers, frequencies, and derived line parameters are given in Table 1. The synthetic spectra (red lines) were computed for a column density of ortho CHCCH of 7.5 × 10cm, a rotational temperature of 9.9 K, an emission size of 40 linewidth of 0.72 km sfor the 2-1lines and of 0.57 km sfor the 5 more intense than the λ 8 mm one, which suggests that the search for CHCCH in other cold dark clouds is more favorable in the λ 3 mm wavelength band. The observations of TMC-1 at λ 3 mm were carried out using the IRAM 30m telescope in September 2021. The observed position corresponds to the cyanopolyyne peak of TMC-1, α= 44141.9and δ= +254127.0. The 3 mm EMIR receiver was used connected to a fast Fourier transform spectrometer, providing a spectral resolution of 48.84 kHz. We covered the spectral region around 93.6 GHz, where the 5-4rotational transition of CHCCH is located. We observed two setups at slightly diﬀerent central frequencies in order to check for spurious signals, line emission from the image band, and other technical artifacts. The observations were performed in the frequency-switching observing mode with a frequency throw of 18 MHz, large enough to avoid possible contamination from negative frequency-switching artifacts arising from the diﬀerent hyperﬁne components of CHCCH. Pointing scans were performed on strong and nearby quasars every 1-1.5 h, with pointing errors always within 3-5. The antenna focus was checked every ∼6 h at the beginning of each observing session and after sunrise. Weather conditions were between good and average for the summer period, with opacities of 0.4-0.5 at 225 GHz and amounts of precipitable water vapor ranging from 1-3 mm to 6-7 mm. The spectra were calibrated in antenna temperature, T, corrected for atmospheric attenuation and for antenna ohmic and spillover losses, using the ATM package (Cernicharo 1985; Pardo et al. 2001). The uncertainty in the calibration is estimated to be 10 %. Article number, page 2 of 5 -4lines (see text). System temperatures varied between 100 and 140 K and the ﬁnal Trms at 93.6 GHz is 1.1 mK after 31.4 h of total on-source telescope time. The ﬁnal spectra shown in Fig. 1 is obtained after averaging the data taken in September 2021 with previous spectra from our TMC-1 3 mm line survey (Marcelino et al. 2007; Cernicharo et al. 2012). At the frequency of the 5-4transition of CHCCH, the observed time in the survey data is 4.0 h. Including these data has improved the ﬁnal sensitivity down to 0.9 mK, resulting in a total on-source integration time of 35.4 h for each polarization (twice this value after averaging the two polarizations). We also present a more sensitive spectrum of TMC-1 at the frequency of the 2-1transition of CHCCH, 37.5 GHz, with respect to that presented by Agúndez et al. (2021a). New data was gathered in several observing sessions between January and May 2021. These data are part of the on going QUIJOTE line survey that is being carried out with the Yebes 40m telescope. The line survey uses a 7 mm receiver covering the Q band, from 31.0 GHz to 50.3 GHz, with horizontal and vertical polarizations. A detailed description of the system is given by Tercero et al. (2021). Receiver temperatures in the observing sessions carried out during 2020 vary from 22 K at 32 GHz to 42 K at 50 GHz. Some power adaptation in the down-conversion chains has reduced the receiver temperatures during 2021 to 16 K at 32 GHz and 25 K at 50 GHz. The backends are 2 × 8 × 2.5 GHz fast Fourier transform spectrometers with a spectral resolution of 38.15 kHz providing the whole coverage of the Q band in both polarizations. The QUIJOTE observations are performed using the frequency-switching observing mode with a frequency throw of 10 MHz in the very ﬁrst observing runs, during November 2019 and February 2020, and of 8 MHz in the later ones.

For the lines observed with the Yebes 40m telescope at 37.5 GHz δν = 0.03815 MHz and rms = 0.19 mK, while for the lines observed with the IRAM 30m telescope at 93.6 GHz δν = 0.04884 MHz and rms = 0.9 mK. The rest of parameters are given in the table. observed intensity is thus the sum of the CHCCH and the syn-C main beam eﬃciency of the Yebes 40m telescope varies from 0.6 at 32 GHz to 0.43 at 50 GHz. The intensity scale used in this work, antenna temperature (T), was calibrated using two absorbers at diﬀerent temperatures and the atmospheric transmission model ATM (Cernicharo 1985; Pardo et al. 2001). Calibration uncertainties were adopted to be 10 %. After including all data taken between November 2019 and May 2021, the total on-source telescope time is 238 h in each polarization (twice this value after averaging the two polarizations). The IRAM 30m and Yebes 40m data were analyzed using the GILDAS software. The rotational spectrum of the propargyl radical has been measured in the laboratory at frequencies below 38 GHz by Tanaka et al. (1997). Due to the existence of two equivalent H nuclei, the radical has ortho/para statistics. Ortho levels have Keven and para levels have Kodd. The statistical ortho-to-para ratio is three. The dipole moment of CHCCH has been calculated by Botschwina et al. (1995) to be 0.14 D, while more recently, Küpper et al. (2002) measured a value of 0.150 ±0.005 D, which is the value we adopt hereafter. Our IRAM 30m data of TMC-1 show a group of lines spanning 6 MHz around 93646 MHz (see top panel in Fig. 1), which http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/ CCH at λ 3 mm for TMC-1 (Cernicharo et al. 2020). √∆v × δν(c/ν)], where c is the speed of light and δν is HOH lines. we assign to the hyperﬁne components of the 5-4transition of CHCCH. The measured frequencies are systematically shifted up by 0.2 MHz with respect to the predicted frequencies in the Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy (CDMS; Müller et al. 2005). The entry in the CDMS is based on a ﬁt to the laboratory frequencies measured by Tanaka et al. (1997). These authors measured the ﬁne and hyperﬁne structure of the rotational transitions 1-0, 2-1, 2-1, and 2-1, lying at 18.7 GHz and in the 37-38 GHz range. Although the experimental accuracy is quite good, a few kilohertz, the limited range of J values covered makes that when extrapolating to the λ 3 mm wavelength band, the frequency errors could be signiﬁcant for radioastronomical purposes. The CDMS quotes frequency errors of just ∼55 kHz for the hyperﬁne components of the 5-4transition, although our TMC-1 observations shows that the error is in fact as high as ∼200 kHz. This is signiﬁcant for a radioastronomical search for CHCCH in sources with narrow lines, such as TMC-1. In order to obtain more accurate frequency predictions for CHCCH we carried out a new spectroscopic analysis using the SPFIT program (Pickett 1991) including the laboratory frequencies of Tanaka et al. (1997) and the astronomical frequencies measured in TMC-1 for the ten hyperﬁne components of the 5-4transition (see derived line parameters in Table 1). The Hamiltonian used for the analysis is the same than that employed https://cdms.astro.uni-koeln.de/ Table 2.

(1997) and it has the following form: H = H+ H+ H+ H(1) where Hand Hcontain the rotational and centrifugal distortion parameters, respectively, His the spin-rotation term, and Hrepresents the magnetic hyperﬁne coupling interaction between the unpaired electron and the hydrogen nuclei. A complete description of these terms can be found in Tanaka et al. (1997). The coupling scheme used is J = N + S, F= J + I, and F = F+ I, where I= I(H) and I= I(H) + I(H). The radical CHCCH has two equivalent H nuclei, the methylenic ones, and the hyperﬁne interaction term His thus written explicitly as a two spin system: H= a·S ·I+I·T·S +a·S ·I+I·T·S (2) where aand Tstand for the Fermi contact constant and the dipole-dipole interaction tensor for the acetylenic hydrogen nucleus, respectively, and aand Tare averages of the coupling constants for the two methylenic hydrogen nuclei that are equivalent. In this manner, each energy level is denoted by six quantum numbers: N, K, K, J, F, and F. Article number, page 4 of 5 Fig. 2. Rotation diagram of ortho CHCCH in TMC-1. The results obtained from the ﬁt are shown in Table 2, where they are compared with those reported by Tanaka et al. (1997). As expected, the new derived parameters for CHCCH are almost identical to those reported before. The inclusion of the 54transition in the ﬁt only aﬀects the rotational constants B and C and the distortion constants ∆and ∆. For B, C and ∆the diﬀerences are smaller than the 3σ uncertainties. However, for the ∆distortion constant the diﬀerence is much larger, as expected, due to the inclusion of rotational transitions with higher quantum number N. We used the spectroscopic parameters obtained in this work for CHCCH to obtain accurate frequency predictions at mm wavelengths. The catalog ﬁle with the predicted frequencies and the calculated intensities at 300 K is provided at the CDS. The intensities are calculated adopting a dipole moment of 0.150 D, the experimental value measured by Küpper et al. (2002). The rotational partition functions used in these predictions are listed at diﬀerent temperatures in Table 3. The rotational partition function was calculated considering a maximum value of 30 for the quantum number N. 3.2. Excitation and abundance of CHCCH in TMC-1, and guidance for further searches We also present the observed spectrum of TMC-1 at the frequency of the 2-1transition of CHCCH (see bottom panel in Fig. 1). This spectrum is more sensitive than that presented in Agúndez et al. (2021a) because it includes additional observations taken with the Yebes 40m telescope. The rms noise level has decreased from 0.30 mK to 0.19 mK, per 38.15 kHz channel. As a consequence, the CHCCH lines are now more clearly detected. The new line parameters derived for the six hyperﬁne components of the 2-1transition of CHCCH are given in Table 1. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the strongest hyperﬁne component of the 5-4transition is about ﬁve times more intense than the strongest component of the 2-1. This is consistent with the rotational temperature of CHCCH being close to the gas kinetic temperature of TMC-1, ∼10 K (Fehér et al. 2016). At this temperature, the 5rotational level, with an energy of ∼13.5 K, is expected to be more populated than the 2level, which has an energy of ∼2.7 K. In addition, the Einstein coeﬃcient of spontaneous emission is about 20 times larger for the 5-4transition than for the 2-1. These facts make the 5-4transition at 93.6 GHz more favorable for detection than the 2-1transition at 37.5 GHz. Indeed, if we assume typical values for the system temperatures, T= 40 K at 37.5 GHz with the Yebes 40m telescope and T= 120 K at 93.6 GHz with the IRAM 30m telescope, and we keep in mind that the line at 93.6 GHz is ﬁve times more intense than the 37.5 GHz line, the radiometer equation tells us that in order to detect the two lines with the same signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) one must invest ∼7 times more integration time at the Yebes 40m telescope than with IRAM 30m telescope. The fact that in our data the 2-1transition is detected with similar or even higher S/N than the 5-4transition (see Table 1) is a consequence of the much longer integration time invested with the Yebes 40m telescope (238 h) compared to that employed for the IRAM 30m spectrum (35.4 h). In summary, the rotational transitions in the λ 3 mm wavelength band, in particular the 5-4at 93.6 GHz (see below), are the most favorable for detection and should be the target in future searches for CHCCH in cold dark clouds. The availability of two rotational transitions with diﬀerent upper level energies allows us to constrain the rotational temperature of the propargyl radical in TMC-1. We built a rotation diagram using the velocity-integrated intensities given in Table 1 and we derive a rotational temperature of 9.9 ±1.5 K (see Fig. 2). We therefore conﬁrm the assumption made by Agúndez et al. (2021a) that the rotational levels of CHCCH are thermalized at the gas kinetic temperature of TMC-1, ∼10 K (Fehér et al. 2016). This fact is expected based on the low dipole moment of CHCCH (0.150 D; Küpper et al. 2002), which implies low critical densities, probably a few 10cm, i.e., well below the volume density of Hin TMC-1, a few 10cm(Pratap et al. 1997; Cordiner et al. 2013). The column density derived from the rotation diagram for ortho CHCCH is (8.2 ±1.7) ×10 cm. A more precise determination of the column density can be obtained by ﬁtting the observed spectra with synthetic spectra calculated under local thermodynamic equilibrium. For this calculation we adopted a rotational temperature of 9.9 K, as derived from the rotation diagram, a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.72 km sfor the 2-1lines and 0.57 km s for the 5-4lines, which are the arithmetic mean of the values derived for the hyperﬁne components of each transition (see Table 1), and assumed that the emission is distributed in the sky as a circle with a radius of 40, as observed for various hydrocarbons in TMC-1 (Fossé et al. 2001). The observed spectra at 37.5 GHz and 93.6 GHz are well reproduced adopting a column density of 7.5 ×10cm(see Fig. 1). Assuming an ortho-to-para ratio of three, the column density of CHCCH (including ortho and para) in TMC-1 is (1.0 ±0.2) ×10cm, which is slightly higher than the value derived previously by Agúndez et al. (2021a). The column density of the closed-shell counterpart CHCCH in TMC-1 is (1.1-1.3) ×10cm(Gratier et al. 2016; Cabezas et al. 2021). Therefore, in this study we conﬁrm that the propargyl radical is thermalized to the gas kinetic temperature of TMC-1 and revise the abundance ratio CHCCH/CHCCH from slightly below one to nearly one. There are other rotational transitions of CHCCH that lie in the frequency range covered by our Yebes 40m and IRAM 30m data. The two other transitions of ortho CHCCH that fall in the λ 3 mm band, the 4-3at 74.9 GHz and the 6-5at 112.3 GHz, are predicted to be as intense as the 5-4. However, our data at these frequencies are not as sensitive as at 93.6 GHz, and thus the strongest hyperﬁne components of each transition are only marginally detected. System temperatures at 74.9 GHz and 112.3 GHz are higher than at 93.6 GHz, making the 5-4 transition the most favorable for detection. There are also several lines of para CHCCH accessible. Two of them, the 2-1at 37.2 GHz and the 2-1at 37.8 GHz, lie in the Q band and are covered by our Yebes 40m line survey, while two other transitions, the 5-4at 92.8 GHz and the 5-4at 94.4 GHz, lie in the λ 3 mm band and are covered by our IRAM 30m telescope data. These lines are predicted to be less intense than those of ortho CHCCH, and thus are more diﬃcult to detect. In our data only the strongest hyperﬁne components of the 5-4and 5-4transitions are barely visible. The S/N is however low and we have thus not attempted to ﬁt them. We detected the 5-4transition of ortho CHCCH in TMC-1 using the IRAM 30m telescope. The measured frequencies for ten hyperﬁne components of this transition are 0.2 MHz higher than the frequency predictions available in the CDMS catalog, a diﬀerence which is signiﬁcant for radioastronomical purposes. We carried out a new spectroscopic analysis of the rotational spectrum of CHCCH in order to provide accurate frequencies at mm wavelengths. The intensity of the 5-4transition, lying at 93.6 GHz, is ∼5 times higher in TMC-1 than the 21previously observed by Agúndez et al. (2021a) using the Yebes 40m telescope. We conclude that a search for CHCCH in other cold interstellar sources should be carried out in the λ 3 mm band, rather than at λ 8 mm, where the telescope time investment is estimated to be about seven times cheaper. The rotational temperature of CHCCH in TMC-1 is constrained to 9.9 ± 1.5 K, i.e., equal to the gas kinetic temperature, and the derived value of the column density is (1.0 ± 0.2) ×10cm, which makes CHCCH one of the most abundant hydrocarbon radicals in TMC-1.
