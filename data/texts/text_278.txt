 heat capacity, thermal expansion, latent energy, volume change upon melting, corrosion rate, etc.) the thermal transport properties are by far the least known, especially for molten salt mixtures and solid solutions. We present in this paper a theoretical framework for accurate predictions of thermal conductivity of multicomponent salt-based PCM, from 273.15 K up to above melting temperature. The solid phase is considered as a microstructure with its proper temperature dependent parameters: phase volume fraction, grain size distribution, porosity, etc. As case studies, five new potential PCMs for CSP applications are considered. Their thermal conductivity is estimated as a function of temperature, from room temperature to 200 K above their melting point. The predictive capability of the proposed framework is discussed based on a comparison with available experimental data. The effect of equilibrium and non-equilibrium microstructural parameters (i.e. phase fraction, phase composition, average grain size, inter-grain, and intra-grain porosity) on the effective thermal conductivity of the solid states of the promising chloride PCMs is discussed. Lastly, recommendations for the design of next generations of PCM materials are suggested in order to improve their thermal transport properties. materials (CSP), Multicomponent Molten Salt system, Material performances, Microstuctures. recently focusing on phase change materials (PCMs), which facilitate heat storage via their latent heat of fusion, as opposed to sensible heat storage materials having relatively low thermal capacity and requiring a considerable volume of the heat storage unit. remarkable progress in the development of PCMs for practical applications. storage (MSES) has been used commercially as a Thermal Energy Storage (TES) method to store heat collected by Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). The heat is then converted into superheated steam to run conventional steam turbines and produce electricity in inclement weather or at night. Various simple eutectic mixtures of different salts can be employed as PCMs for MSES. Chloride mixtures are widely used as PCMs due to their relatively high heat storage capacity and low cost (except those containing LiCl), despite their low thermal conductivity. for the next generation of CSP is a real challenge which first of all requires to identify eutectics on multicomponent systems. In general, the identification of eutectics and therefore potential new PCMs is simply done by analysing available phase diagrams. For salts systems, most of the binary and several ternary phase diagrams are available, but very few diagrams for quaternary and higher order systems have been published, limiting considerably the exploration of PCMs offering better performances in terms of energy storage capacity and charging/discharging heat process. In principle, the FactSage software and FTsalts database binary and ternary salts systems (chlorides, fluorides, bromides, iodides, carbonates, nitrates, nitrites, hydroxides, sulphates,…) by identifying eutectics or simple minima upon liquidus (azeotrope-like), via phase diagram calculations. The calculations of quaternary and higher order phase diagrams are however much more complex and not really accessible in the entire temperature range (above the liquidus temperature) and composition. To identify the local minima upon the liquidus surface, we have developed a software combining FactSage and the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm, problems under non-smooth and non-linear constraints. The identification of a PCM consists in searching, via a particular minimization procedure based on MADS, range of multicomponent systems. By employing the procedure of Gheribi et al. low-cost PCMs (< 750 USD/metric) operating at a temperature of 663 K can be identified, allowing the generation of steam upon efficient heat transfer while restricting the corrosion rate of the containing materials. Of course, a phase change material suitable for CSP is not only a eutectic or a simple minimum upon the liquidus surface in a certain range of melting temperature. An optimal PCM must meet a certain number of drastic constraints and objectives on raw materials prices and long term availability, on thermophysical and thermal transport properties and corrosion resistance with respect to the low cost steel tanker as well. Due to the increasingly growing demand (mainly for battery applications) and a high cost (>7000 USD/ton), PCMs containing Li-based salts (LiCl, LiF, Li top of Li- based salts, the materials containing strategic metals, in particular rare earth element or those very scarce such as Cs and Rb based salts cannot be considered. Among the potential PCMs identified within multicomponent systems, only those with the best material performance can be retained as CSP materials. An optimal PCM must ideally meet the following requirements • largest possible volumetric latent heat of fusion, > 450MJ/m • largest possible thermal conductivity in solid and liquid states, >1 W/(m.K), to provide  • a small relative volume change upon melting, <15%, to maximize the tanker capacity;  • a minimal system vapor pressure at working temperature, <100 Pa; • a minimum corrosion rate of the steel tanker, <50 m/year.  Note that not only the PCM composition and melting temperature can be determined via FactSage but also the volumetric latent heat of fusion, the volumetric heat capacity, the volume change upon the melting. Even though the corrosion product can be also predicted with the FactSage software, the corrosion rate can only be determined experimentally, via a series of corrosion tests. Thermal conductivity or thermal diffusivity are key properties in the design of CSP plants as they are necessary for estimating heat transfer rates using fundamental heat transfer equations. Unfortunately, a severe lack of experimental on thermal conductivity of molten salt mixtures and solid salt systems is observed.  datasets reported for many systems, only a few of them may be considered as reliable, mainly the  CO…) are not suitable for next generation of CSP. For the same reasons, on most recent ones. In general, up to more than 100% discrepancy is observed between the different experimental datasets. inexistent for ternary and higher order systems. For simple ionic solid compounds (NaCl, KCl, LiF…), there are several consistent experimental datasets for the temperature dependent thermal conductivity (diffusivity) reported in the literature. However, solid systems rarely contain simple compounds, they are in general consisted of a phase assemblage of more complex compounds, resulted from a reaction between endmembers (e.g NaCl + MnCl The thermal conductivity (diffusivity) of most complex salts and solid solutions remains unknown from an experimental point of view. Note that the thermal transport properties of solid systems do not only depend on the phase amount, but on several microstructural parameters: phase’s average grain size and phase’s grain size distribution, microstructure configuration, porosity size and distribution, etc.  thermal conductivity (diffusivity) of molten salt mixtures and solid salt microstructures. approaches combine a series of theoretical models which can be parameterized either (i) via a CALPHAD-like method considering experimental data, not necessarily on thermal conductivity, but on other thermophysical properties (heat capacity, thermal expansion, elastic constants, velocity of sound,…), or (ii) ab initio via molecular dynamics or DFT simulations.  thermal conductivity of PCMs from standard temperature (273.15 K) up to above the melting temperature. This methodology summarizes the different models for both liquid and solid states that were developed and for which the predictive capability has been validated in our prior works. As case studies, the thermal conductivity of 5 promising chloride based PCMs, melting around 390C, are predicted as a function of temperature. The variation of thermal conductivity with phase volume fraction and upon the solid-solids phase transition and melting is discussed. Lastly, the impact of microstructural parameters upon the thermal transport of “real” salts solid systems is quantified and discussed. Recommendations to improve the thermal transport properties of PCMs for the next generation CSP are proposed.  temperature (273.15 K) up to hundreds K above the melting temperature consists in a series of theoretical models supported by DFT based atomistic simulations. These models were already published and will not be repeated in details here, but we wish to make a synthesis of the theoretical framework allowing to predict the thermal conductivity of PCMs in a wide range of temperatures. At the melting temperature, a PCM undergoes a first order phase transition, i.e from a solid to a liquid state. The solid state consists in a microstructure with intrinsic characteristic called microstructural parameters which are: phase distribution, phases’ volume fractions, microstructure morphology, phases’ average grain sizes, grain size distribution, porosity level, porosity size and distribution. The liquid phase consists, in principle, of a homogenous mixture with, depending on the system, different degrees of chemical ordering, from quasi fully dissociated mixtures to those with a strong short range ordering leading to the formation of coordination complexes and polymers. Note that, in principle for a PCM no liquid/solid biphasic region exists. theoretical model for the thermal conductivity of a molten salt compound, temperature. To achieve this, the Boltzmann transport equation has been solved assuming ions as hard spheres, i.e. the interaction potential is assumed to be null above a certain critical radius (hardsphere radius) and infinite below this radius. This model is in principle, predictive as it contains no information on the thermal conductivity but only a few key thermodynamic properties. It is expressed as follows:  thermal expansion coefficient, the velocity of sound, the molar volume and the Grüneisen constant all taken at melting temperature,  anionic and cationic radius. According to this formalism, the temperature dependent thermal conductivity of molten salts can be predicted providing that  with an appreciable accuracy. Overall, the model has shown a very good predictive capability with  , , ,  and  are respectively the heat capacity at constant volume, the most molten salts matching with most recent experimental data within a margin of less than 20 %, which is about the typical experimental error. Note that Eq. 1 has, in general, a better accuracy than molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) based on Fumi-Tosi potentials, dipole(quadrupole)-dipole(quadrupole) polarization and dispersion contributions. Thereafter, given the severe lack of experimental data, a similar theoretical approach has been developed to describe the composition (X) dependence of the thermal conductivity of non-reciprocal molten salt mixtures, , i.e mixtures with only one common anion (Cl proposed model for molten salt mixtures is also based on the kinetic theory and requires only few key thermodynamic data for its parameterization. In a nutshell, the composition dependence of the thermal conductivity of molten salts mixtures is expressed as: conductivity of a hypothetical molten mixture consisted of ions with identical centers of mass. From the kinetic theory, it can be shown that composition of the ratio:  fluctuation effect upon the thermal conductivity and therefore its composition dependence.

In CALPHAD like databases, in particular FTsalt, the critically assessed model parameters for both heat capacity and density are available for pure, binary and ternary systems. Then, considering a reliable extrapolation technique, systems to predict the thermal diffusivity of multicomponent molten PCMs. first, an accurate knowledge of the phases constitutions and the phases volume fractions as a function of temperature.

For each phase, in addition to the temperature dependent thermal conductivity, its volume fraction must also be determined as a function of temperature. Note that the evolution of the phase volume fraction is defined through its thermal expansion coefficient.  systems is nowadays mainly performed via the CALPHAD method. The CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse diagrams) method is an effective computational approach to represent the thermodynamic properties of various phases through Gibbs energy models, and compute phase equilibria of multicomponent systems via Gibbs energy minimization under compositions constraints. To predict the phase equilibria within multicomponent systems, reliable databases must be available, containing critically assessed Gibbs energy parameters for at least unary, binary, and ternary subsystems. The prediction of phase equilibria within higher order systems is then performed based on suitable extrapolation of the phase’s Gibbs energy. multicomponent systems, the predictive capability of phase equilibria using the FTsalt database in the FactSage thermochemical Calculation Package addition, all local minima upon liquidus surface of a multicomponent system can be identified by the FactOptimal software which is also included in FactSage range via the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm. points of the quaternary and quinary subsystems within LiF-LiCl-NaF-NaCl-KF-KCl-SrF were predicted with an appreciable accuracy, liquidus temperature and 0.025 mole fraction for the composition in comparison with the available experimental data. dependent thermal conductivity must be affected to each phase. The thermal conductivity of electrically insulating stoichiometric compounds is mainly of vibrational origin (phonon) and, depending on optical properties (surface emissivity), may also contain a significant radiative contribution at higher temperature (T of solid salt compounds,   When the phase distributions are quantified, a temperature and/or composition  Where  is the average atomic mass;  is the number of atoms per primitive cell; and the constant     is a material constant which only depend on the Grüneisen parameter, . general, much lower than that of the corresponding compounds.

The composition dependence of adiabatic bulk modulus of salt solid solutions can be estimated from the Flancher and Barsh model. In other words, according to the present formalism the composition dependence of the thermal conductivity of a simple solid solution can be estimated from thermal conductivity parameters of end-members (compounds). compounds (NaCl, KCl, MgCl thermal diffusivity data available in the literature. However, a severe lack of experimental data is observed for transition metal salts (MnCl compounds (e.g. K developed in our prior work parameters from experimental information on heat capacity, thermal expansion and bulk modulus as a function of temperature. In a nutshell, according to this methodology, the high temperature limit of the Debye temperature and Grüneisen parameter involved in the temperature dependent expression of the thermal conductivity (Eq. 3) are determined via a multi-objective fitting procedure based on the Debye-Grüneisen formalism to reproduce available experimental data on thermal expansion, heat capacity and the elastic constants from low temperature up to high temperature (ideally from 0 K up to the melting temperature). When experimental data are not available, both the Debye temperature and Grüneisen parameter are calculated by ab initio along with thermodynamic and volumetric properties by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the Quasiharmonic Approximation (QHA) method. However, QHA is known to overestimate the lattice expansion contribution upon the thermodynamics properties leading to the violation of the Maxwell relations and therefore to the consistency between the thermodynamics properties.  To overcome these limitations, we have developed an extension of the QHA approach (thermodynamically self-consistent (TSC) method relations. The TSC method has shown a good predictive capability for a large variety of materials not only for thermodynamic properties accurate prediction of both Debye temperature and Grüneisen parameters. To illustrate the predictive capability of TSC method, the calculated thermal expansion (defining the temperature  CoCland KCaCl). To alleviate the lack of experimental data, we have dependence of the volume fraction) and the thermal conductivity of CsCl single crystal (cubic-B2, Pm-3m) are shown in Figure 1 in comparison with available experimental data.  The agreement is found to be very good in the entire range of temperature. Such good agreement originates, however, from the fact that CsCl crystalizes in a simple structure and it is almost isotropic with respect to its elastic properties. For complex compounds (such as Na conductivity is found to be also good, in general less than 20 % of error is observed. as a given phase assemblage with intrinsic parameters called microstructural parameters. In our approach, the microstructural parameters are:  A- Equilibrium properties obtained via FactSage from PCM nominal composition  CaAlF) the capability of TSC to predict the thermal expansion and thermal  B- Non-equilibrium parameters determined via characterization experiments determined via the FactSage software, providing both thermodynamic and physical properties, and databases containing sufficient information on unary, binary and ternary systems for a reliable extrapolation for higher order systems. There are several approaches to describe the impact of the phase assemblage upon the thermal conductivity of the microstructure. The phase assemblage model depends mainly on the microstructure configuration and the porosity distribution. In its solid-state, a salt system is consisted, in general, of grains of almost uniformly distributed porosity even though they may have very different grain sizes. In this case, the effective medium theory (EMT) can, in general, better describe the phase assemblage effect upon the thermal transport. According to the EMT approach the thermal conductivity of a solid system with zero inter-grain porosity (macro-porosity),  Where , , average grain size and the intra-grain porosity (nano-porosity) also of the phase i. and intra-porosity vectors.  The following expression have been derived from the Boltzmann thermal equation (BTE) to consider the grain size dependence upon the thermal conductivity of individual grains:   (6)   and  denotes respectively the volume fraction, thermal conductivity, the  Where  is a temperature dependent phonon characteristic length within the grain and it can be estimated from the Debye temperature, the thermal conductivity of single crystal, the thermal expansion coefficient, heat capacity and the Grüneisen parameter (see ref. that the grain size dispersion can be considered by weighting the grain size via Gaussian damping factor depending on the standard deviation of the grains size distribution. From an empirical point of view, it is known that up to a certain level, the intra-porosity (nano-porosity) decreases the thermal conductivity of grains almost linearly, but above a certain porosity level (in general, depending on the materials, it is around 10-20%) the intra-porosity decreases the thermal conductivity more rapidly. To include this behaviour, Odelevskii expression:  In which m in an empirical parameter related to the pore size and distribution, in general for insulating material it varies between 5 and 10. Note that at low porosity the above formalism leads to a linear behaviour of the thermal conductivity of grains with intra-porosity. m can also be linked to the porosity level above which the thermal conductivity starts to decrease more rapidly than (1). In our approach, the inter-grain porosity (macro-porosity,  conductivity of a solid system is described effectively and globally, i.e. the inter-grain porosity is considered as an average parameter for the entire system (no inter-grain-grain porosities are considered). Without a loss of generality, the thermal conductivity of a solid system, expressed as:  Where  is a function describing the average inter-grain porosity level upon the entire solid state system. We have shown that in the case of inter-grain porosity, there exists a critical porosity,  beyond which the thermal conductivity starts to decrease rapidly. interpreted as a second order phase transition associated to grains-porosities symmetry breaking. In a nutshell, according to this theory, when the inter-grain porosity increases, the probability of grain-grain contact decreases dramatically, leading to a critical decrease of the phonon mean free path and therefore to the thermal conductivity as well. Note that another interpretation of this critical behavior can be found in the percolation theory. formulated as: Where  is a critical function depending on the critical porosity as: tanker’s material; (iii) be available in large quantity; and (iv) have a melting temperature of 390 ± 10C (or 663 ± 10 K), in our previous study, we have shown that chlorides are the most suitable systems. Beside Li-, Cs- and Rb-based salts, rejected because of their high prices, fluorides and hydroxides are also unsuitable because of either their high melting temperature range or their ability to corrode the low-cost steel tanker. Thereafter, we have identified five low-cost PCMs with the FactOptimal software (Table 1), and we have calculated the thermal conductivity of these PCMs from the standard temperature of 273.15 K up to 200 K above the liquidus temperature. Among the five PCMs of interest, there is 1 ternary system (E1), 3 quaternary systems (E2, E3, and E4), and 1 quinary system (E5). In most works presenting potential PCMs, only ternary multicomponent PCMs are investigated. The fact that we can identify and do calculations for multicomponent systems is very important in fine-tuning thermal physical properties and designing the most suitable PCMs for TES applications. The nominal compositions of the 5 eutectic PCMs were calculated automatically by the robust, rapid, and reliable FactOptimal software and the FTsalt     (10) database. Besides the occurrence of many compounds and solid solutions precipitated at the eutectic temperatures, several solid-state first-order phase transformations are observed from room temperature up to the melting temperature (Table 1).

When considering the evolution of the thermal conductivity of the PCMs with temperature, first and foremost, we have estimated the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient and thermal conductivity of liquid compounds as a function of temperature using Eq. 1 (Table A1 and Table A2). For common molten salts such as NaCl, KCl, CaCl using Eq. 1 in our previous study available experimental sound velocity. available experimental data of sound velocity, Initial Molecular Dynamic simulation (AIMD) giving a more consistent value with other experimental sound velocities of other alkali halides. The temperature dependent thermal conductivity calculated using Eq. 1 is in agreement with the results obtained via First Principle Equilibrium Molecular Dynamic simulation (FP-EMD). Our calculated thermal conductivity of molten MgCl MgCl binary and NaCl-KCl-MgCl experimental data. and NiCl. For those chlorides, their thermal conductivity is calculated from Eq 1. (Table A2) using the physical properties derived from the available experimental density of molten salts as a function of temperature compounds and end-members of solid solutions involved in the phase transformations of PCMs (Table 1) have been considered for estimating their physical properties, in particular, thermal conductivity (Tables A3 and A4). Parameters for some common chlorides (NaCl, KCl, CaCl etc.), for which physical properties are widely available in the literature are easy to obtain. Other chlorides, especially complex solid compounds such as KPb  is then used to predict the temperature dependent thermal conductivity of KCl-  There is a lack of thermal conductivity data on molten PbCl, MnCl, CoCl,  KCoCl, Na properties, especially thermal conductivity (Tables A3 and A4).  phase transformations of the five promising PCMs are estimated with reliability and models for calculating the thermophysical properties of solid solutions, solid phase assemblages and liquid solutions are available, the evolution of thermophysical properties of the PCMs from 273.15 K up to 200 K above the melting point is computed subsequently. Except for the thermal conductivity, the evolution of all other physical properties of PCMs with temperature is shown by using the FactSage thermochemical Calculation Package more favorable the material for TES. Among the five PCMs of interest, E5 has the largest value of latent heat and it also has the smallest volume change during liquid-solid state transformation at the eutectic temperature, allowing the best usage of the tank capacity (Table 2 – light green cells). A material with a large molar volume change like E1, E2 is unfavorable as potential PCMs (Table 2 – dark orange cells). Considering the investigated PCMs, E3 and E5 are the two PCMs satisfying some of the requirements for an optimal PCM fusion, large volumetric heat capacity, and relatively small volume change upon melting (Table 2). properties including heat capacity (C thermal conductivity ( (Note that results in this table were calculated for 1 mole of each PCM, favorable values are shown in light green cells and unfavorable values in dark orange cells):  NiCl, etc. are parameterized by using the TSC method, providing reliable physical  ) of both solid assemblage and liquid phase at T of the five potential PCMs  ) 294.86 346.75 498.48 243.71 561.36  K) at T 1.84 1.76 1.85 1.68 1.88  C (MJm ρ (g/cm ρ (g/cm conductivity can be performed. By solving Eq. 6 using the volumetric fraction of phases obtained from the FTsalt database and CALPHAD models available in FactSage, evolution from 273.15 K up to 200K above the melting point of all the eutectic PCMs of interest have been plotted (Figure 2-6). Our calculated thermal conductivity of multicomponent liquid E2 is reasonably reproducing the experimental data reported by Wang et al. the composition of E2 is different from the investigated composition of Wang et al. only a small amount of CaCl those of the PCM reported by Wang et al. and their thermal conductivity values of the liquid forms are comparable (Table A2).

In the case of E3, the solid state at any temperature consists of four different solid solutions and compounds (Table 1). At the same temperature, the thermal conductivity of any of the solid solutions or compounds in the solid state of E3 is normally a few times smaller than that of the simple chlorides forming E3 (i.e. NaCl, MgCl of atoms per primitive cell. In general, a solid state of a PCM consisting of several solid solutions volume fractions of phases with temperature for the E5 PCM.   (Table 2, Figure 2-6). It is understandable since pure chlorides, in general,  , in a wide temperature range (from 273.15 K up to the eutectic temperature) and/or complex compounds should have a significantly lower thermal conductivity than the simple compounds forming the PCM. It means that neglecting the phase constitution of solid state and only considering the composition of the material would provide a severely wrong estimation of the thermal conductivity (about 2 times in the case of E3). Therefore, basic knowledge of phase fractions and phase compositions contributing to a solid state is mandatory for an effective prediction of its thermal conductivity.  conductivity of a PCM at phase transformation temperatures should be investigated cautiously and monitored with care because it considerably affects the heat transfer process and therefore the operation of the CSP. There exists an immediate increase of the thermal conductivity of every investigated molten salt mixture at the eutectic temperature as the liquid phase transforms into the solid phase assemblage (Figure 3-6). A lower thermal conductivity or less effective thermal energy transport of the liquid phase is associated with a larger intermolecular spacing and more random movements of the molecules in the liquid state compared to the solid state. Furthermore, our calculations also show abrupt changes in the effective thermal conductivity of the solid phase assemblages at the temperatures of solid phase transformations (Figure 2-6). In some cases, like E1, E3, E5, a sudden drop of the effective thermal conductivity within a range of temperature is due to the stability of a complex compound or solid solution comprised of large molecules. For example, the sudden decline of the effective thermal conductivity of E3 at  by the solid phase transformation from Na which has 51 atoms per cell (Figure 4). The larger the molecule of a complex compound or solid solution, the more unlikely it is to have a high thermal conductivity (Eq. 3), therefore, the formation of any complex compound or solid solution during phase transformations is unfavorable for any promising PCMs.  equilibrium properties obtained via FactSage from PCM nominal composition, the effect of nonequilibrium microstructural parameters (i.e. average grain size, porosity) on the calculated effective thermal conductivity is treated. The effects of average grain size and porosity are quantified in our calculations of the effective thermal conductivity of the solid state E1 PCM (Figure 2c, d) by using the Microstructure Module of FactSage 8.1. conductivity of solid state E1 decreases with a decrease of the average grain size and increase of porosity (Figure 2c, d). In general, the thermal conductivity of a polycrystalline is considerably lower than that of the corresponding single crystal due to the thermal resistance at the grain boundaries. The thermal resistance of the grain boundary is a decreasing function of the average grain size (Figure 2c). The increase of grain boundary thermal resistance is commonly attributed to the shortening of the phonon mean free path. The grain size influence is more significant at low temperatures (Figure 2c), where the phonon mean free path is comparable to the average grain size. Due to the boundary effect, the thermal conductivity loss is from 6 to 10% as the average grain size of the E1 solid state reduces to 1 μm (Figure 2c). A loss of about 10% of thermal conductivity of a solid state with the average grain size of 1 μm is commonly reported in various materials such as MgO, α-Al In addition, the discontinuation of movements of the molecules in a solid state due to porosity should certainly diminish the effective thermal conductivity (Figure 2d). Intra-grain porosity (nano-porosity) has a stronger effect than inter-grain porosity (macro-porosity). The thermal conductivity declines by only 3.7% with 10% inter-grain porosity while a drop of 10% is observed in the case of 10% intra-grain porosity (Figure 2d). There has been no clear explanation as to why inter-grain porosity has a weaker effect on thermal conductivity than intra-grain porosity. One possible explanation is that as intra-grain porosity occurs within individual grains, it then reduces the phonon mean free path significantly. If inter-grain porosity stayed at the grain boundaries, it would just slightly reduce the phonon mean free path, hence reducing the thermal conductivity less significantly. In summary, both the reduction of the average grain size and augmentation of inter-grain or/and intra-grain porosity result in the interruption of movements of the molecules in a solid state hence diminishing its effective thermal conductivity.  atomistic simulations for examining the evolution of the thermal conductivity of multicomponent systems from standard temperature (273.15 K) up to hundreds K above the melting temperature. The models have been applied for 5 promising chloride PCMs which are identified by using the CALPHAD database and MADS algorithm. A good agreement between our calculations and the available experimental data has been revealed, proving the reliability of the model. We have shown that it is critical to have a reliable thermodynamic database correctly estimating the phase fractions and phase constitutions because without it, based only on the nominal composition PCMs, the thermal conductivity can be incorrectly predicted with a substantial error. Besides the expected sudden change of thermal conductivity of the PCMs at the liquid-solid state transformation, there exists rapid alternations of thermal conductivity due to the solid phase transformation, allowing the formation of complex compounds or solid solutions. The more complex compounds or solid solutions with a high number of atoms per primitive cell contributing to the solid state, the lower the value of thermal conductivity. A diminution of thermal conductivity is also attributed to a small average grain size and/or a large inter-grain and/or intra-grain porosity. We believe that the current model of thermal conductivity as a function of temperature is reliable and helpful for engineers and scientists when designing PCMs for improving TES of CSP. To obtain better thermal conductivity, the chosen PCMs should have a maximized amount of simple crystallographic structures (i.e. minimized amount of complex compounds or complex solid solutions), a large average grain size, and a minimal porosity.  of Canada (NSERC) [funding reference number: RGPIN-2021-03279].
