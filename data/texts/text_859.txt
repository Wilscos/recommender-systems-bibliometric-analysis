Costes <sylvain.v.costes@nasa.gov> Human space exploration beyond low Earth orbit will involve missions of significant distance and duration. To effectively mitigate myriad space health hazards, paradigm shifts in data and space health systems are  necessary to enable Earth-independence, rather than Earth-reliance. Promising developments in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning for biology and health can address these needs. We propose an appropriately autonomous and intelligent Precision Space Health system that will monitor, aggregate, and assess biomedical statuses; analyze and predict personalized adverse health outcomes; adapt and respond to newly accumulated data; and provide preventive, actionable, and timely insights to individual deep space crew members and iterative decision support to their crew medical officer. Here we present a summary of recommendations from a workshop organized by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, on future applications of artificial intelligence in space biology and health. In the next decade, biomonitoring technology, biomarker science, spacecraft hardware, intelligent software, and streamlined data management must mature and be woven together into a Precision Space Health system to enable humanity to thrive in deep space. Astronauts face hazards unique to spaceflight such as ionizing radiation, altered gravitational fields, accelerated day-night cycles, confined isolation, hostile-closed environments, distance-duration from Earth , planetary dust-regolith , and extreme temperatures/atmospheres . As astronauts experience these hazards, the body responds by adapting and deconditioning over the duration of the exposure with the potential for synergistic effects as the exposures persist . As humanity plans exploration of deep space and planetary-class missions (i.e., cis-Lunar, Mars), astronauts would benefit from access to optimally scoped healthcare and medical systems to ensure success for a given mission. However, many current gaps in knowledge and technological challenges exist which limit the ability to accurately predict the necessary surveillance and mitigation capabilities needed for deep space missions. The transition from LEO to deep space missions will present novel operational health requirements. To develop a new paradigm for deep space travel, where real-time communication, massive data transfer, and immediate technical guidance is not an option, the development of multi-layered, efficient, and automated biomedical monitoring, predictive analytics, and clinical decision support must all be integrated into an intelligent deep space health system . Redistribution of medical decisions, biological data, and data management responsibilities must occur among the participants in this process (i.e., the on-board Crew Health and Performance [CHP] system, the crew themselves, the crew medical officer [CMO], the Environmental Control and Life Support system [ECLS], MCC, and others ). Such a system must be maximally autonomous when appropriate for the mission and system, increase crew autonomy from Earth, and avail crew of precious time. The system must be as autonomous as possible, but with an essential link to human crew members to assess, evaluate, and act on the resulting data. It will need to identify, predict and provide health solutions to problems before they arise, as well as continuously managing and analyzing an expanding accumulation of environmental, biological and health data. It should provide the CMO with explainable insights into the complexities between the biological environment, crew health, and mission-specific requirements (e.g., destination, duration, vehicle, habitat), as well as offer predictive outcomes depending on courses of treatment (or no treatment). There is an opportunity for spaceflight biology, health, and medicine to leverage the advances in computer science for deep space. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and biological-computational modeling all utilize sample data to create a representation of a system that can predict an outcome of interest on future, previously unseen data . We envision an AI-driven, proactive ‘Precision Space Health’ system, ensuring that care is predictive, preventative, participatory, and personalized . Such an approach supports the crew themselves and their CMO to make evidence-based health decisions. Spaceflight healthcare needs to evolve toward a Precision Space Health system powered by AI/ML tools for automated assessment and prediction in deep space missions; however, the technologies and techniques for in-mission PM/PH usage have yet to be realized. Terrestrial approaches to PM/PH are still maturing and have limited clinical implementation. However, there are developments in these fields where the data collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data and biomarkers are making significant headway when coupled with AI/ML approaches . In Table 1, we summarize current technologies to highlight promising paths forward. As evidenced in Table 1, current spaceflight-ready technologies are limited to health monitoring. Available terrestrial technologies are in varying stages of maturity and require additional investment in development on Earth, but show promise and relevance to detect and mitigate spaceflight risks. Each of these fields are advancing individually, some rapidly, some very slowly, and often only indirectly related to the challenges of human spaceflight. These technologies must be developed in parallel and woven together with a common goal in mind if they are ever to support space exploration. We discuss each of these key technologies in detail in the following sections. The proposed Precision Space Health system will depend on robust sets of biomarkers for early disease detection and prediction , shifting the model of crew health from treatment to prevention This necessitates investment in future terrestrial and space research to identify key biomarkers to predict specific disorders. Biomarkers can be used as markers of dysfunction and also of successful countermeasures. These measured biomarkers must also be safe, reliable, and reproducible in order to assess biomedical function and assess environmental impacts on health , and biomarkers must be distinguished between those which are causal versus indicative of a disease . While the suite of clinically actionable biomarkers are still being discovered and implemented, biomarker screening has the potential for improved health maintenance through enabling early identification of subclinical changes, which in turn enables early intervention and prevention. As real-time audio/video evaluation capabilities decrease in deep space travel, we propose that biomarker monitoring will crucially make up for these deficiencies by providing a detailed knowledge base regarding the real-time status of human health and biological systems. Further, the development of AI-driven models capable of individualized interpretation of biomarkers will allow further acceptance and establishment of monitoring thresholds on a personalized basis . We discuss several examples of potential spaceflight health biomarkers below. For biomarker research as well as in future real-time space health monitoring, longitudinal measurements will be essential to detect individualized health changes. As the NASA Twins study showed , even comparing an astronaut to their twin on earth is limited: the best baseline for an individual is oneself. For example, continuous monitoring of temperature with wearables has shown that fever thresholds change between individuals, or with age, gender, or ethnicity . Similarly, systems-level analyses have shown variations in immune setpoints and microbiome composition across the population along a continuum. Previous efforts have successfully demonstrated individualized monitoring of changes to self-baselines using blood , digital devices , and non-invasive saliva sampling , enabling personalized coaching of individuals and microbiomes . Such approaches can first establish baselines of various biomarkers for each astronaut individually on Earth. AI methods for time-series analysis, particularly utilizing changepoint or anomaly detection, can be used to identify potentially adverse medical events through monitoring deviations from a healthy baseline using longitudinal data When digital twin technology is mature, having a digital twin of each astronaut (rather than a biological twin) would aid predictive power . When comparing metrics in space, careful consideration must be taken to understand if observed changes reflect a healthy response or not. Long-term changes over the course of a mission will provide insight into whether an astronaut is slowly drifting to an unhealthy state or simply adjusting to their new environment. Model organism reference experiments and missions can also be a testing bed for longitudinal, individualized, and predictive spaceflight health monitoring. Of significant importance, novel phenotypic manifestations and situations should be expected to occur in deep space, due to the concurrent synergistic interactions between the several known spaceflight health hazards . The use of reinforcement learning and n-of-1 studies may help provide statistical power to derive multi-targeted treatment, behavioral interventions or activity interventions (specific to individuals) during a mission in order to address novel phenotypes. We propose a multi-layered monitoring approach including both the spacecraft environment and individual astronauts (Figure 2) as part of a Precision Space Health system. Both non-contact and contact devices will be used to monitor individual astronauts. Novel semi-automated assays to monitor the entire spacecraft and all habitable environments should be developed. This holistic monitoring would provide for the first time a continuous picture of the health of the entire spacecraft or habitat, and the living ecosystem inside. The initial layer of monitoring would involve the continuous environmental sensing of physical (vibrations, humidity, temperature, airflow, sounds, electromagnetic radiation, etc.), chemical (carbon dioxide, oxygen, dust particles, volatile organic and inorganic compounds, etc.), and biological (general microbiota and specific species with known health risks) components. Many of these sensors are already standard instruments for LEO missions, so it would be straightforward to begin testing integration of sensor data, ML models, and human in-the-loop inputs . For example, radiation instruments currently in use on the ISS and planned for lunar missions gather real-time data on absorbed radiation dose and dose rates . However, extrapolation from absorbed dose to specific biological effects require a detailed knowledge of the components of the space radiation field, which in turn requires post-processing on the ground . AI models deployed in situ for deep space missions could integrate data and provide real-time estimates of biological radiation risk to assist in the prescription of appropriate physical or biological or pharmaceutical countermeasures, with data also being used for terrestrial long-term health management post-mission. Next-generation sensors with integrated data processing and analytics should be introduced to streamline and enable immediately decipherable metrics. The AI approach of active learning should be considered especially for this first layer of monitoring, which uses intermittent human input and annotation to adapt to changes in the environment and facilitate assessment (uncertainty, diversity, randomness), of constant and large amounts of monitoring data from interdependent environments. These results can be presented to the crew with easily interpretable readouts. These data would also be transferred to the spacecraft or habitat Precision Space Health system for analysis and integration with existing knowledge of the biological effects of environmental stressors. A third layer would be based on molecular-physiological biomarkers and/or truly ‘invasive’ measures obtained from various swabs, blood draws, saliva sampling and other molecular assays. A ‘smart toilet’ (as well as smart showerbooth, smart mirror) could preserve and prepare waste specimens for biochemistry assays and microbiome profiling . Such platforms hold promise in expanding to include in situ and real-time analytical capabilities. Similarly, non-invasive high-frequency monitoring of molecular components from saliva over time can also provide immune signatures that may be used to monitor deviations from a healthy immune baseline, utilizing anomaly detection algorithms to assess changepoints as potential adverse medical events . Paired with an AI-assisted biological knowledge base including expected baselines and biomarkers, such non-invasive approaches could assist in predicting adverse health outcomes and identifying preventive actions. Also of crucial importance for missions beyond the Earth’s Van Allen Belt (which conveys a degree of radioprotection), molecular and sophisticated dosimetry will be essential for high resolution detection of both DNA damage and gauging pharmaceutical stability . This entire multilayered and integrated monitoring approach would be attractive for crews, as it is less invasive, less cumbersome and encourages more participation with near-immediate and seamless feedback. Such a layered system would increase the accurate monitoring of the true health of the ecosystem and the crew, by developing a more holistic model that integrates multidimensional and multimodal measures. Historically, computing hardware and data transmission systems to support astronaut health have been predominantly designed for LEO operations, relying on terrestrial computing using downlinked biosensor telemetry catered to a ground-based flight surgeon. As humanity embarks on long-duration cis-Lunar and planetary-class exploration missions , the computing hardware and data transmission requirements for astronaut health systems will change, as will the feasibility and approaches for model training in Earth-linked vs in situ settings. For Lunar spaceflight and habitats, the volume of health-related data may grow to the point that it is no longer viable to downlink the datasets and they must instead be processed in situ using Lunar information technology centers with sufficient computational capacity. For Mars missions, high-latency communications prohibit real-time health support and AI applications must offer near real-time capabilities, operate in situ and be maximally autonomous. Therefore, the hardware and data communication strategies for astronaut health beyond LEO must adapt to optimally balance the continued efficacy of terrestrial computing for certain needs (e.g., routine monthly blood-work analysis) versus the importance of autonomous AI support for time-sensitive requirements (e.g., ECG monitoring of an astronaut during a Mars surface excursion). For these in situ needs, environmental and flight requirements will also impact the design of computing, storage and communication systems . These factors include volume, weight and power constraints, resilience to launch vibration, chemically reactive planetary dusts, ionizing radiation and reliability in the context of autonomous maintenance and repair. The pioneering development of the Spaceborne Computer-1 and -2 aboard the ISS has made inroads toward this, along with testing on-board graphics processing units (GPU) for AI and ML capabilities, including real-time base calling that can detect modified nucleic acids . Future AI and data systems need to be designed to minimize the need of transferring data back to Earth, or take advantage of ML-based data compression or active learning systems based on pre-trained, constantly learning ML systems , all while working within the limited computing environment of a spacecraft or distant habitat. With respect to AI/ML models, most current terrestrial AI techniques use large numbers of observations (and usually a large feature set) to train a model. The application of these methods to human health in the context of spaceflight exploration is challenging for several reasons. First, biomedical data collected from astronauts in-flight are historically and currently limited. Just over 600 people worldwide have gone to space, and only 24 beyond LEO. Missions have had an average duration of fewer than 30 days, making it almost impossible to train sophisticated AI/ML models using only spaceflight human data. Second, the data collected during spaceflight have been narrow and inconsistent compared to what is typically available in clinical or research settings on Earth. Until recently, there was no standardized set of biomedical measures taken during NASA human spaceflight explicitly for research purposes . Finally, NASA’s mission of exploration means that the models needed for Precision Space Health must extrapolate beyond the context in which we have spaceflight experience. Even though the laws of physics do not change over the course of a deep space mission, the human body does, and potentially in non-linear ways, thus lowering the accuracy of the “approximation” training data. A key consideration for AI medical applications is whether the system needs to be trained in situ using locally collected data, or if the model can be trained using ground data prior to the mission, during the mission with an uplink of the updated model, or gradually developed into active learning systems to add another degree of autonomy. These distinctions are important since training a model is typically intensive computationally, and requires large amounts of data, whereas performing inference with a trained model is far less demanding. Table 2 summarizes the workshop recommendations and considerations for developers, scientists, stakeholders and others dedicated to the realization of AI-modeling systems for space biological research and Precision Space Health. The computing hardware, model software, and data management and communication strategies for Precision Space Health need to be maximally adaptive to accommodate constant reassessment from newly acquired data. This is challenged by the need for high data security, as well as spacecraft mission constraints on mass, power, volume and data bandwidth. The feasibility of such a system relies on several factors. First, the predictive maturity of relevant biomarkers and data must be identified and prioritized for sensor development. Second, clinical (personalized) thresholds that can alert when an individual astronaut may be approaching a preventable health issue threshold must be identified and validated. Third, the implementation of threshold-based health assessment must be operationalized for in situ analysis in the context of the astronauts involved in a particular spaceflight mission and time course. Overall, this system will be supported by proactive prioritization of data return. Current communication bandwidth estimates for medical needs do not consider AI analytics and will need to be updated. Research should determine which data type is deemed absolutely essential and mission-critical for Earth-return, to enable flight surgeons and scientists at MCC to provide support (and for researchers to analyze). Further development in ML data compression techniques will aid this process. For interpretable real-time data and analytics, as well as post hoc data sharing to Earth (i.e., likely transferring data via laser communications relay or radio frequency ), the development of these biomedical monitoring, data acquisition and knowledge extraction systems will rely on pre-defined, robust metadata structures, ontologies, and transfer to data sharing-analytical repositories on Earth. This is covered in the separate companion biological research review article reporting on the workshop (Sanders et al., 2021 [unpublished preprint]). Integrated biomedical flight data acquisition, AI-modeling tools and techniques, as well as a Precision Space Health system will be crucial pillars in bridging the gap between our current LEO operational paradigm and that which is needed for successful cis-Lunar and planetary-class missions. The crew's need for progressive independence from Earth, in terms of health and biological self-sufficiency, is largely an informational problem. Workshop participants agreed that all avenues of data, technology, and technique development ought to be explored (not solely AI/ML). How much degradation of crew health and capability should we expect? How much long-term health risk will astronauts face post-career? These questions can only be answered by scientific research, and that is reliant on strong data systems in future missions which can collect, analyze and enable interpretation of results. How much decision support and data analytics capability should be built into a mission to maximize chances of success? This question is limited by current and projected space data capabilities, AI-modeling capabilities and a dearth of opportunities for human systems integration and testing. The science, spaceflight and medical communities have a responsibility to meet ethical obligations involved in a Precision Space health system and related data privacy . Whole-genome sequencing will likely be a pre-flight component required to enable an effective AI-driven Precision Space Health system. Clear governance, policy and sincere care must be taken to handle the privacy and wishes of all spacefarers (NASA Astronauts, but also international and private-commercial space travelers). Deidentified data systems with decoupled federated learning systemic firewalls are one approach to ensure data are explicitly not traceable . For broad data analysis to occur to support deep space health, completely untraceable data must be attained to protect any impacts on multi-generational offspring to their privacy and quality of life. Development of modified Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) guidelines and waivers for utilization of spaceflight genomics data, should be considered for the rights of astronauts and their relatives, with the understanding that new guidelines may need to be developed in the future as technology progresses and is incorporated into space missions. Knowledge and data from both fundamental and applied space biomedical research is part of a crucial translational pipeline to inform a Precision Space Health system. Such research builds a wealth of evidence and statistical power upon which AI biomedical predictions rely. The lifecycle of AI/ML and the cross-cutting relationship between space biological research and Precision Space Health is presented in Figure 3. Metadata and data curation-processing standards for Precision Space Health and the field of space biology need to be determined, ensuring data are ‘AI-ready’ and modeling accessible. A space Data Readiness Level metric can be developed as a tool to encourage reliable data quality . Basic synthetic datasets and model libraries for space health and biology also need development, and are part of enabling broad participation by computer scientists, biologists, and algorithmic developers. It is worth considering that AI and modeling approaches of established ‘big data’ companies and academics may not be suitable for space challenges. Adaptations and innovations in statistics, algorithms, data, and medical informatics are almost certainly going to be required and modified for spaceflight health and biology (Sanders et al., 2021[unpublished preprint]). Deep space missions will have one-of-a-kind space biology and health requirements. The interdisciplinary breadth of the teams required to develop, collaborate, refine, and implement these systems is novel. For example, bioinformaticians, clinicians, biologists, algorithmists, data system architects, medical informaticians, engineers, data curators, computer scientists, programmers, are only a few of the categories to consider. The workshop was organized with this interdisciplinary framework in mind, with participants spanning four general domains as seen in Figure 4. Additionally, to effectively implement all components of Precision Space Health and biological research systems, developers must be collaboratively interwoven so biological researchers, data architects, operational clinicians, and hardware engineers are not siloed within their own domains. Compared to terrestrial and LEO settings, information will likely flow more freely between research and clinical operations during deep space missions, which could result in novel discovery outcomes. For example, a recent research team utilizing an ultrasound device was interested in blood flow behavior in the internal jugular vein in long-term ISS mission crew. The team noticed anomalies in venous blood flow, which in turn led to a clinical team hand-over who proceeded to fully characterize (and treat for) flow stasis and venous thrombosis . The integrated data architectures for CHP and the Precision Space Health system are an enabling technology with two goals: (1) improved scientific understanding of the mechanisms of deterioration, and (2) targeted monitoring, prevention and interventionist health countermeasures to ensure mission success . In other words, the same data systems that collect and analyze health and performance related information for research purposes can also provide monitoring and decision support to feed back the best information for operational needs. The development of the information, data, and AI-modeling systems discussed in this paper will be multi-year, interdisciplinary, and involve far-reaching collaborations across science, engineering, medicine, and operations. As humanity explores beyond LEO, it will leave the confines of an immediately accessible, large, and continuously supportive cohort of mission control health and science staff, with systems that have been developed over the past ~60 years. As deep space missions must be light, robust, agile, and maximally autonomous, the relatively recent development of terrestrial AI, ML, and modeling tools offer a key contribution toward making humanity multi-planetary through spacecraft and habitat biomedical science support and a Precision Space Health system.

To explore the future role of AI-modeling in space biology and health, NASA held a workshop in June 2021.  The workshop was organized by the NASA Space Biology Program within the Biological and Physical Science Division, part of the NASA Science Mission Directorate.  The NASA Human Research Program also supported and participated.  The workshop gathered a cohort of external-to-NASA AI-modeling subject matter experts (SME) in the fields of digital health, computer science, bioinformatics, medicine, microbiology, biomedical imaging and computational biology. On the second day of the workshop, the SME cohort and space-related researchers outlined AI and modeling recommendations and concepts for the next decade in space biology and space health.
