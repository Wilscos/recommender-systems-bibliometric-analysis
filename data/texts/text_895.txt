Abstract: Tax analysis and forecasting of revenues are of paramount importance to ensure fiscal policy’s viability and sustainability. However, the measures taken to contain the spread of the recent pandemic pose an unprecedented challenge to established models and approaches. This paper proposes a model to forecast tax revenues in Bulgaria for the fiscal years 2020–2022 built in accordance with the International Monetary Fund's recommendations on a dataset covering the period between 1995 and 2019. The study further discusses the actual trustworthiness of official Bulgarian forecasts, contrasting those figures with the model previously estimated. This study's quantitative results both confirm the pandemic's assumed negative impact on tax revenues and prove that econometrics can be tweaked to produce consistent revenue forecasts even in the relatively-unexplored case of Bulgaria offering new insights to policymakers and advocates.  Key words: Forecast, taxation, VAT, personal income tax, Bulgaria  1.1. How the pandemic is changing forecasts Over the last year or so, official and academic  general trend behind upcoming developments has eroded confidence. So much that the Fiscal Affairs Department (FDA) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the most often employed techniques to forecast tax revenue will not suffice to grasp the major decline in tax revenue that the pandemic will cause in most countries. (IMF FAD 2020, 1).  Similar issues have already puzzled the economicpolicy establishment for a while now. Hence, new fiscal-forecasting models can take advantage of the important steps towards new models (Demertzis and Viegi 2008; Brubakk and Sveen 2009; Alessi et al. 2014) in the area of monetary-policy forecasting (Demertzis and Viegi 2020; Demertzis and Dominguez-Jimenez 2020). Yet, this vast knowledge is not a solution per se as it does nothing to reduce the novelty of the ways in which the pandemic is  and will continue  affecting the economy. Moreover, looking across the fence cannot be the solution since tax-revenue forecasting manifests more than a few peculiarities. Hence, this paper tries to put in place a workable approach to tax revenue forecasting by      insights from non-fiscal forecasting.  1.2 Background of the study This paper focuses on Bulgaria, a small, open and relatively backward economy.

In the past decade (20092019), tax revenues grew on average by 2.45% on a yearly basis. These figures lag far behind the average 5.10% yearly GDP growth over the same period.

With all probability, no recover will be in sight until at least 2021. Thus, policy choices apt to spur new growth need a brave midterm perspective embracing the postcrisis recovery phase (Demertzis 2021). Thus, understaing tax revenues' dynamics is vital for Bulgarian policymakers and citizens.  The objective of this research is to forecast the revenues generated by the value added tax (VAT) and the personal income tax (PIT) for the fiscal years 20202022. In doing so, this paper is  (NSI 2020b) rather than being driven by policy. Moreover, this pick-up brought relatively few funds and the fiscal multipliers are going to be smaller in any case (Karagyozova-Markova, Deyanov, and Iliev 2013, 30). Fisca  ineffectiveness is partly due to the high degree of informality, which determines difficulties in tax collection (Rosser, Rosser, and Ahmed 2000, 160) as well as revenue mobilisation (Dellas et al. 2017). prescient of both the indication provided by the   The second section describes a baseline scenario ignoring the pandemic and in which policies do not change significantly.

Here, estimates admit a greater degree of arbitrariness and contestability because of the               (IMF FAD 2020, 8) for the baseline scenario.  Reasoned estimates are offered for a series of parameters then fed into a multivariate regression model to forecast revenues. These two forecasts are then compared to one another and to official governmental forecasts from the past years. The models are verified by several error statistics (mainly root mean squared error, RMSE), the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test, and Theil’s U statistic ( ).  The time series used cover the years from 1995 to 2019. The two forecasted scenarios attempt to predict personal income tax revenue (PIT) and value added tax revenue (VAT) in 20202022. Where needed because of scarce data (e.g., regarding excises and customs duties), necessary approximations are explained in the text.  First, the ARIMA model for both time series is estimated following all indications offered by the main works in the literature (Tiao and Box 1981; Harvey and Todd 1983; Box et al. 2016). This approach has been employed productively in the estimation of tax revenue for emerging economies in general (Streimikiene et al. 2018) and transition economies in particular (Legeida and Sologoub 2003).  Whenever a third variable is supposed to effect revenue, causation and directionality are proved applying the Granger (G-causality) test (Granger 1969). This technique also finds wide applicability to the analysis of taxation (Heckelman 2000; Tosun and Abizadeh 2005).       through RMSE (Nau 2014; Streimikiene et al. 2018), DM tests (Diebold and Mariano 2002), and (DoT Australia 2008).           stationarity. There are various means to proves whether a set of data is stationary by looking for a unit root. The Augmented DickeyFuller (ADF) test used here is probably the most widely of such proofs in academia to date (Dickey and Fuller 1979; 1981; Streimikiene et al. 2018, 728).  There are several ways to describe a multivariate linear regression. Most notably, one can choose between the scalar form and matrixes. Opting for the latter, such a model can be built in a few steps (Arminger, Clogg, and Sobel 1995, 97) and summarised in the following equation:  Stationarity is a useful property in regard to meeting (or supposing) the three assumptions of multivariate regression are met (Ibid., 9899).  One of the best techniques to forecast future values in time series is the ARIMA model. Its basis is a mixed process including an autoregressive (AR) and a moving average (MA) component. The AR          process is expressed as a finite, linear aggregate of previous values of the process and a random  (Box et al. 2016, 89) A stationary AR process is by mean reverting (Ki Wolters, and Hassler 2013, 44). By contrast, the MA component expresses each deviation from past values as      (Box et al. 2016, 9). Obviously, MA processes are not mean-reverting. Thus, ARMA process partially absorb exogenous shocks via the AR component while being permanently modified by them due to the MA one. number of times the process has to be integrated before becoming stationary.  Various techniques are employed to assess the  in comparison to official forecasts and alternative mode         (Streimikiene et al. 2018, 731)    (DoT Australia 2008, 7ff), and the DM test.  In addressing how the behavioural and policy changes induced by the pandemic affect tax revenues it is necessary to establish causality between variables. The technique adopted to do so is the G-causality test, which is based on ordinary least squares regression (Granger 1969).  Data stationarity is essential to then employ the ARIMA model and other analogous techniques.  The ADF test shows that both VAT and PIT are non-stationary at level. The unit root can be removed by differencing once.  The ARIMA model is used for forecasting purposes by taking into account the entire time first difference of the dataset going from 1995 to 2019 for both VAT and PIT. The auto-correlation function (ACF) and the partial ACF shows the  In this way, PIT revenues in 2020 would be        growth of 7.87% in 20202022.

The alternative forecasts need to account for the fact that people were physically prevented from leaving their homes, with unpredictable effects on their capability to earn an income. Moreover, being self-induced, the crisis poses novel interrogatives. True, some sectors are benefitting from the current situation. However, new jobs can supply for less than a third of total dismissals in advanced economies (Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 2020, 11)      -shaped (Telarico 2021) is undeniable.  Overall, the impact on consumption and incomes is likely to be even bigger for less-developed countries (Estupinan and Sharma 2020) by the      incomes to poorer households (Narula 2020). Moreover, young and female workers are more likely to be hit by the crisis (Blustein et al. 2020; Chakraborty 2020; ILO 2020).  3.4 Value-added tax The VAT is the main source of tax revenue for  udget. Its regressive effects, due to poor households' higher propension to consume (Carroll and Kimball 1996; Carroll et al. 2017; Morozumi and Acosta Ormaechea 2019; Fisher et al. 2020), are well-known and studied (Tamaoka 1994, 6069; Kato 2003, 3). However, the pandemic has shown how downward-flexible consumption can be (Brinca, Duarte, and Faria-eCastro 2020) when an exogenous shock strikes at the same time both demand and supply across a number of sectors (Guerrieri et al. 2020).

Then, VAT revenues for 20092019 are estimated by feeding a multivariate-regression model with a summary of GDP (TABLE 3), finalconsumption (EU Commission 2020, 175) and Cefficiency forecasts    on the formula shown in Keen 2013, 427ff). The granger test proves causality between each of these independent variables and VAT revenues.  On this basis, VAT revenues in Bulgaria could have fallen by as much as 17% in 2020. The recovery in 2021 and 2022 would be rather slow and unsatisfying (5% and 6% respectively), with revenues still at 96% of their 2019 level by the end of 2022. A reduction in compliance and collection efficiency  estimated through a drop in CEfficiency  would mean a 10% fall in VAT  PIT is the second largest source of tax revenue for        income and consumption does not always translate in more consumption; yet, falling incomes almost      (Diacon and Maha 2015; for transition economies see: Kolasa 2012). In the case of Bulgaria, one needs to remember that about half of the households depend on employment income (47.2%) (EUROSTAT 2020b).  Thus, the pandemic has likely impacted the livelihood of, at least, about half of Bulgarian households.  There are only a few datasets offering fine-grained       various sorts of income.

Against the background of growing government expenditures (EU Commission 2020, 175), a decline in VAT revenues would probably lead to budget disbalances.

Total pensions (PEN), total social transfers (SOC) and total employment income (WAGE) were chosen as predictors because taken together, they account for over 99% of average disposable income (NSI 2020c).  It is relatively easy for policies to act on the factors determining PIT revenues. In fact, the Bulgarian government established a furlough and other wageprotection schemes (Milcheva 2020; Draganov 2020)       employment incomes by about a third (EUROSTAT 2020c).

Finally, social contributions are assumed to overgrow their upward trend (EUROSTAT 2021b) to supply for about 30% of the fall in salaries in 2020. As wages get more dynamic in 2021, the trend is smoothed somewhat downward, falling from 7.63% to 5.80%. Due to sustained GDP growth, the precrisis trend should resume in 2022   1.43% in 2021 and 4.92% in 2022.

The economic recovery in 2021 and 2022 should allow for a further increase in revenues by about 17% and 6% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. By the end of the triennium, PIT revenues would be 51% higher than in 2019.  The forecast-error statistics summarised in TABLE 4 (below) affirm the multivariate regression         and VAT (panel B).

The former has a smaller RMSE, median error (ME), median square error (MSE),  That both VAT and PIT forecasts are sophisticated baseline estimates and official data may lead to two observations. First, the common assumption as regards GDP growth may hold true almost surely in the sign and probably in the order of magnitude.

For a start, that PIT revenues could increase is not necessarily good news for anyone who cares about balancing the budget. As a matter of fact, the estimated growth in social transfers and pensions would vastly offset these gains and even cause a mean absolute error (MAE), mean percentage error (MPE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and standardised MAPE than either of the two       these results. Conversely, the ARIMA model underperforms official statics under all indicators but MSE and RMSE. Interestingly, official forecasts do not show the upwards bias alleged by some (Frankel 2011; Frankel and Schreger 2013).  CHART 1 (on page 22) and CHART 2 (on page 23) shows the actual and forecasted VAT and PIT revenues for the period 20102022.

The undertaken study has a few limitations. For instance, because of the currency board, the case of Bulgaria offers the advantage of ignoring exogenous shocks that may passthrough via the de- or appreciation of the exchange rate.

The lack of high-frequency datasets is also an obstacle in attempting to consider other macroeconomic indicators such as inflation and unemployment. This hinderance was partly bypassed by diverting the analysis to correlated variables (i.e., employment income as a proxy for un- and under-employment). Yet, further studies may endeavour to explore this area.
