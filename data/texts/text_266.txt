Predicting the next interaction of a short-term sequence is a challenging task in session-based recommendation (SBR). Multi-behavior session recommendation considers session sequence with multiple interaction types, such as click and purchase, to capture more eective user intention representation suciently. Despite the superior performance of existing multi-behavior based methods for SBR, there are still several severe limitations: (i) Almost all existing works concentrate on single target type of next behavior and fail to model multiplex behavior sessions uniformly. (ii) Previous methods also ignore the semantic relations between various next behavior and historical behavior sequence, which are signicant signals to obtain current latent intention for SBR. (iii) The global crosssession item-item graph established by some existing models may incorporate semantics and context level noise for multi-behavior session-based recommendation. To overcome the limitations (i) and (ii), we propose two novel tasks for SBR, which require the incorporation of both historical behaviors and next behaviors into unied multi-behavior recommendation modeling. To this end, we design a Multi-behavior Graph Contextual Aware Network (MGCNet) for multi-behavior sessionbased recommendation for the two proposed tasks. Specically, we build a multi-behavior global item transition graph based on all sessions involving all interaction types. Based on the global graph, MGCNet attaches the global interest representation to nal item representation based on local contextual intention to address the limitation (iii). In the end, we utilize the next behavior information explicitly to guide the learning of general interest and current intention for SBR. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets show that MGCNet can outperform state-of-the-art models for multi-behavior session-based recommendation. • Information systems → Recommender system. session recommendation, graph neural network ACM Reference Format: Qi Shen, Lingfei Wu, Yitong Pang, Yiming Zhang, Zhihua Wei, Fangli Xu, and Bo Long. 2018. Multi-behavior Graph Contextual Aware Network for Session-based Recommendation. In WXXXX, June 03–05, 2021, XXX, XX. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/1122445.1122456 Recommendation systems are widely used in online platforms, as an infrastructural tool to select interesting information for users and alleviate information overload. Recently, in feed streaming applications including media streaming (e.g., TikTok and Spotify) and e-commerce (e.g., Amazon and Alibaba), recommendation systems need to focus on the interactions within the current active session for satisfactory recommendation results. Conventional recommendation methods that usually learn static user preferences from the long-term historical interactions, e.g., collaborative ltering [17], are typically not suitable for these scenarios. Therefore, sessionbased recommendation (SBR) where the recommendation relies solely on the user’s behavioral sequence in the current session, has attracted great attention in the past few years. Generally, SBR aims to predict next item a user would likely to consume, based on the recent items interacted by the user in an ongoing session. Inspired by the advancement of deep learning techniques, various neural network-based models have been developed to capture the short-term intention of users, and have achieved promising results [7, 26]. Despite the prevalence of the above SBR methods, most of them concentrate on capturing user preference based on single type of interactive behavior sequence solely. However, in practical recommendation tasks, there are naturally multiple behavior interactions in user sessions with complex behavior transition patterns, which are overlooked by the common SBR methods. Take the e-commerce system as an example, in an ongoing session, a user may click, collect or even purchase goods according to the current personal intention. Intuitively, dierent behavior types reect dierent user intention strengths. For instance, the adding-to-favorite behavior is a stronger intention signal compared to the click behavior. Moreover, various behavior patterns may reveal implicit item relationships. For example, the item transitions with click2click or click2purchase behavior pattern may be replaceable (e.g., click iPhone then click SAMSUNG phone), while the item transitions with purchase2purchase or purchase2click pattern may be complementary (e.g., click item iPhone then purchase MacBook). Therefore, it is a challenging but valuable work to eectively model multi-behavior sequence for SBR. Despite the existence of a handful of models that integrate multibehavior information for SBR [11,24], these works suer from two limitations: • The recommendation is limited to the specied target behavior.Traditional frameworks for multi-behavior session-based recommendation (MBSBR) usually allocate a specic interaction type as target behavior and explore other behavior data as auxiliary information. This restriction of the target behavior contributes to deciency of generalization to other target behavior session recommendations and fails to achieve the unied modeling for multiplex behavior for next user-item interaction. Meanwhile, the sparsity of the target behavior data may limit the capability of learning generally item transitions comprehensively. More importantly, the session recommendation with presupposed target behavior deviates from the real scene, which is unknown for next behavior type. The designation of target behavior seriously limits the application of these methods. • The relation of next behavior and historical behaviors are not comprehensively explored.Existing methods encode the current multi-behavior relational session without the injection of next behavior, which ignore the intention strength signals for next item and contextual semantics information between next behavior and former behavior sequence. For instance, as illustrate in Figure 1, dierent next behavior types will lead to dierent next interaction items of session𝑠. For current user who has explored phone-related items, the next click behavior indicates the further exploration intention with other uninteracted items like𝑣, while next purchase behavior implies the summative exploitation intention which prefers to the historical item in current session, like 𝑣. Meanwhile, many works constructed a global item-item graph, consists of item-transitions overall sessions, and utilized variations Figure 1: A toy example of Multi-Behavior SBR. of GNNs to enhance the item representations by augmenting crosssession interaction patterns for SBR [6,24,25]. For multi-behavior session data, multi-relational behavior pattern is additionally introduced to global item graph as edge attributes. However, the injection of other item-transitions information will incorporate two levels of irrelevant noise for current session intention representation learning: (i) semantics level, which may aggregate other irrelevant behavior pattern information for current item representation under the related behavior modality. Especially, diverse behavior patterns with dierent item relations make dierent contributions to current behavior. (ii) context level, which may introduce irrelevant contextual information to current session representations caused by the information loss of the conversion from dierent sessions to pairwise item transitions without distinctive session information. We illustrate this with an example in Figure 1. Generally, after the encoding of GNN which ignores the local transition of current session, the global item representation of𝑣contains various item transition information with dierent interest, i.e., Apple-related interest and phone-related interest, and dierent behavior patterns semantics, i.e., purchase2purchase and click2click, which conicts with the original phone-related intention of clicking item𝑣within current session 𝑠. Motivated by the aforementioned challenges, this work proposes two general tasks for MBSBR. The rst task oers all kinds of next behavior types for item recommendation in a unied way, which extends the single target behavior based task of mainstream researches. More generally, the second task masks the next behavior type consistent with real scenes, and requires an explicit prediction of next behavior through historical interaction data to guide the prediction of next item. To address the above tasks, we propose a Multi-behavior Graph Contextual aware Network for MBSBR. Following previous works for SBR, we construct a multi-behavior global item transition graph based on all sessions involving all interaction types. Based on the global graph, our model attaches the global interest representation to nal item representation based on local contextual intention. In the end, we utilize the next behavior information explicitly to guide the learning of general interest and current intention for SBR. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: •We propose two novel tasks for multi-behavior session-based recommendation, which require the incorporation of both historical behaviors and next behaviors into unied multibehavior recommendation modeling. •To address two proposed tasks, we develop a unied Multibehavior Graph Contextual aware Network (MGCNet), which integrates global intentions of global transitions overall sessions and local intentions of current session, and injects the signicant next behavior signals into session representation explicitly. •Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our model is superior compared with state-of-the-art models for MBSBR. Session-based Recommendation.Early SBR methods widely used Markov chains to capture the sequential signal in session sequences [16,23]. Following the development of deep learning, many neural network based approaches have been proposed for session-based recommendation. Due to the sequence modeling capability of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), RNN-based methods have been the most popular methods for SBR [7,9,10,15,19,29]. For instance, GRU4Rec [7] was rstly proposed to utilize GRU layer to capture item interaction sequences. Based on GRU4Rec, NARM [9] utilized the attention mechanism based on last interaction item after RNN to capture the global and local preference representation of the user in the current session. More recently, a large number of methods relying on graph structure have appeared for recommendation. Motivated by the powerful capability to extract complex relationships between objects of graph neural networks (GNNs), these methods proposed to utilize the GNNs to extract the item transition patterns for SBR [2,12–14,25,26,28]. The rst work is SR-GNN [26], which converted the interaction sequence into a directed graph and employed the gated GNN (GGNN) on the session graph to learn item embedding. GC-SAN [28] further adopted self-attention mechanism to capture global dependencies among dierent positions and integrated GGNN to generate the session embedding. To form better graph structure from the session, LESSR [2] proposed a lossless encoding scheme which preserved the edge-order and sequential information. GCE-GNN [25] exploited two GNN modules to learn two level item representations separately: the session-level item embedding based on current session graph and the global-level item embedding based on global item-transition graph, and then integrated dierent-level item embeddings into the nal session representation based on the position-aware attention. Multi-behavior Recommendation.Conceptually, multi behavior recommendation models multiple types of user-item feedback for enhancing recommendation on target behaviors [1,3– 5,8,21,30]. Current mainstream research employed the collaborative ltering or GNN-based models to capture the user-item interaction feature from multiplex behaviors. Gao et al. [3] proposed a tailored collaborative ltering model which correlated the multibehavior prediction in a cascaded way. As a GNN-based method, MBGCN [8] constructed a heterogeneous user-item graph to represent multi-behavior interactions, and captured the item-to-item similarity and user-to-item relations to model the semantics and inuence of multiplex behavior. Besides, some works focus on modeling the interaction order with multiplex behavior information for sequence recommendation. For instance, KHGT [27] proposed to distill the type-specic user-item interactive patterns by graphstructured transformer module at rst, then encoded the cross-type behavior hierarchical dependencies by an attentive fusion network. Distinguished from above SBR methods which capturing current user preference based on singular type of interactive behavior sequence, multi-behavior session-based recommendations predict the next item based on the multiplex behavior session sequence. Currently, multi-behavior session-based recommendation is still in the early stage of research. MGNN-SPred [24] rstly proposed to learn global item-to-item relations through GNN and integrate embedding of target and auxiliary of current session by the gating mechanism. MKM-SR [11] incorporated user micro-behaviors into session modeling to capture the transition pattern, modeled the item relation and the behavior sequence through the GGNN and GRU. However, these methods usually regarded historical auxiliary user-item interactions as weak signals for forecasting next item with target behavior, which merely utilized all behavioral data for joint learning through a unied model without limitation to designated next target behavior. Besides, the complicated relations between next behavior and historical behaviors have not been comprehensively considered. In this work, we aim to explore the abundant semantic relations among multiplex user behaviors in current session. Given the entire session setS, item setVand interaction behavior setO, we rst dene a multi-behavior item sequence as 𝑠 = {(𝑣, 𝑜), (𝑣, 𝑜), ..., (𝑣, 𝑜) ∈ 𝑆, where(𝑣, 𝑜)represents the user interacted item 𝑣∈ V with the behavior 𝑜∈ O. Problem Statement.To achieve the unied modeling for diverse next behavior SBR, we present the formulation of the problems researched in this paper as below. • Task 1: Next-item Prediction with Given next Behavior.Given a multi-behavior session𝑠, the expectation of this task is to predict the next item𝑣with provided next interaction type𝑜∈ O. In other words, given a session with target next behavior𝑜, here task 1 for MBSBR is to predict the next item𝑣that the user is most likely to interact with the provided target behavior𝑜. This task extends the common single target behavior based task of mainstream MBSBR researches in a unied way for diverse next behaviors. • Task 2: General Next-item Prediction.Given a session 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆without the restrictions of specic target behavior, we explore to predict the next user-item interaction type 𝑜∈ O, moreover, estimate the probability of next item 𝑣under the predicted behavior𝑜. In other words, the model not only needs to predict the next behavior (e.g., buy or click) but also give should predict the next item under the predicted next behavior (e.g., next item the user will click or buy). As shown in Figure 2, MGCNet contains four main components: Heterogeneous global graph augmentation layer, Behavioral contextaware item representation layer, Multiplex behavior session modeling layer, and joint predictor. With the global graph augmentation and context-aware item representation layer, each item representation integrates the global transition patterns of all users with activated contextual information. Furthermore, at the multiplex behavior session modeling layer, we obtain the user’s latent interest and behavior motivations respectively. With the injection of given next behavior from data or feed by joint predictor, our model not only considers the historical behavior sequence but also the next latent behavior. Finally, the joint predictor estimates the probability of candidate items and the interaction types. In particular, our model is mainly designed for Task 2, but it can also be applied to the basic next-item prediction with target behavior for Task 1. As mentioned above, the aggregation of diverse item transitions over all sessions may augment the item representations for SBR. And the abundant multi-behavior relations are conducive to capture the latent intentions. Therefore, we construct the global heterogeneous multi-behavior item transition graphG = (V, E)by taking all items as nodesVand each type of cross-behavior patterns as edgesEfrom training session sequences. For instance, the sequential operation of clicking item𝑣and buying item𝑣in one session is converted to the adjacent relation(𝑣, 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑘2𝑏𝑢𝑦, 𝑣)inG. Furthermore, for capturing long-distance item transitions with same behavior, we introduce the same interaction based adjacent dependency{(𝑣, 𝑜2𝑜, 𝑣) | 𝑜= 𝑜, |𝑖 − 𝑗 | >1, (𝑣, 𝑜), (𝑣, 𝑜) ∈ 𝑠, 𝑠∈ 𝑆} to G explicitly. We next present how to propagate features on heterogeneous global graph to encode item-transition information from all behavioral sessions to improve the accuracy of recommendation. Our Graph Encoder rstly aggregates the neighbor nodes with each relation respectively and gathers the inner-semantic information as updated node representations for heterogeneous multi-relation graph following [18]. Lethdenote the embedding of item𝑣after𝑘layers GNN propagation. The item IDs are embedded in𝑑-dimensional space and are used as initial node features in our model,h∈ R. Following [22], we calculate the attention weights based on the similarity of each item transition and the statistic times of occurrences for each relational subgraph, respectively. The aggregation process of each relation can be denoted as follows: 𝑟 ∈ Ris the specic relation for current subgraph, e.g. click2click, 𝑤is the weight of edge(𝑣, 𝑟, 𝑣)in global graph,W, W∈ Rand a, W∈ Rare trainable parameters. After attention-based inner-relation propagation model, we accumulate all behavior pattern messages to generate cross-relation representation. Meanwhile, we add self-connections to maintain the information mobility with corresponding representation at previous layer. where𝑅indicates the set of all behavior patterns,Wmaps the previous layer embedding to current semantic space. After the message passing of inner-semantic and cross-semantic on heterogeneous multi-behavior global graph, we obtain the global representationh= h, which is dependent on itself and its immediate adjacent items with multiplex behavior patterns. The item representation learnt from heterogeneous global graph overlooks the contextual information in current multi-behavior session. Therefore, we propose a method called Behavioral ContextAware Attention (BCAN), which integrates rich global semantic information with specic session related item embeddings. The core idea is to estimate the relevance between neighbor items and user’s local intentions based on the item transitions and behavior patterns. To capture the local user intentions in current session, we employ a GRU model to encode the interaction item sequence with multibehavior information: whereq=h∥ oconcatenates the initial item embedding hwith behavior type embedding o. Based on the representation of the local interest, we rstly calculate the relevance score𝛼between the local intention of item𝑖 and the general attraction of item 𝑗: 𝛼= softmaxLeakyReLUcosWc, Wh,(6) Then we aggregate neighbor item embeddings together based on weight𝛼to obtain the nal behavioral context augmented item representations on the current session. Finally, we combine the local and global item representations by hyper-parameter intention factor 𝛽 as follows: Through the module above, we obtain behavioral contextualaware item representations with the reduction of unrelated global intentions and the enhancement of corresponding interaction information. To obtain a session representation with multiple user feedback types, the fusion of behavior information and item transitions in current session requires comprehensive consideration. As discussed above, it is essential to model the behavior-specic intention strength and cross-behavior contextual information for MBSBR, involving the next behavior tag and historical interaction types. Meanwhile, the next intention of user is dynamic and not necessarily continuous with last item. Therefore, it is reasonable to portray session representation with the historical intention and the current intention. To meet the above requirements synchronously, we propose this module to capture the exible item transitions and behavior patterns. To learn the historical interest of the current session, we employ a general interest based attention mechanism. In detail, given the item 𝑣in the current session, we concatenate the item representation hlearnt from the BCAN module with the embeddings of the corresponding behavior, the given target behavior type and the reversed position: where behavior type embeddingo∈ Rand reverse position embeddingp∈ Rare trainable initial parameters. Here, reversed position [25] reects the chronological order of item transitions from last to rst. Moreover, a pseudo target behavior tag is predicted in Task 2, which depends on prediction module and will be represented in next part. Then, the correlation of each behavioral item and general historical intentions is obtained by the attentionÍ mechanism based on coarse-level average poolings=m of all items in this session: where𝜎is an activate function,W, W∈ Randr , b∈ R are trainable parameters.no To simplify the formula, we useAttentionm|𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝐿, s to denote the attention module, which calculates the attention scores between each itemmand anchor embeddingslike formula Equation 11. Analogously, the current intention of user is learnt by an itemlevel soft-attention mechanism:no Then we combine the current intention and the historical preference representation to generate the nal session representation: To infer the next behavioral intention, we also apply a local intention anchored soft-attention mechanism as follows: where Wand bare trainable parameters. Intuitively, the calibration of next behavior can help capture the next interaction intention more eectively. For Task 1, the target behavior tag is oered following the denition, and all we need to do is estimate the probability of candidate items forced by the ground truth behavior type. For Task 2, we rstly predict the next behavior based on the historical behavior patterns and item transitions, then feed it to session representation module as a pseudo-tag to assist the next-item prediction. To predict the next interaction type, we estimate the probability of all kind of behavior based on current behavioral intention representation: Then we select the max probability behavior type as the presumed next behavior 𝑜= maxˆ𝑏for Task 2. Based on the session embeddingSobtained above and the initial embeddings of candidate items, we can compute the recommendation probabilityˆy of candidate items: whereˆ𝑦∈ˆydenotes the probability that the user will interact with item 𝑣∈ 𝑉 in the current session. The objective function can be formulated as a cross entropy loss as follows, which consists of next item lossLand next behavior loss L: wherey ∈ Randb ∈ Rare one-hot vectors of ground truth for next item and next interaction type, and𝛾is a control parameter for joint learning.𝜆indicates the loss weight of behavior𝑜. For Task 1, we only optimize the item lossLwithout the considering of next behavior prediction. In this section, we conduct extensive experiments on multi-behavior session-based recommendation to evaluate the performance of our model by answering the following four research questions: • RQ1:Compared with other state-of-the-art MBSBR models, does our model achieve better performance? • RQ2:Is the introduction of multi-behavior sequence information ecient for the performance of our model? • RQ3:How do the key modules of MGCNet inuence the model performance? • RQ4:How does the setting of hyper-parameters (such as the depth of GNN) aect the eectiveness of our model? 5.1.1 Dataset. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets in the session-based recommendation research: Yoochoose and Tmall-1 month [24,26]. These datasets both contain the multiple types of user feedback (e.g. click and purchase) information that can support our work on multi-behavior session-based recommendation. •Yoochooseis derived from the RecSys Challenge 2015 and contains a stream of user actions on an e-commerce website over a period of six months.The operation types include click and buy. •Tmallcomes from IJCAI-15 competition, which contains anonymous user’s shopping logs on Tmall online shopping platform with click, add-to-favorite and buy interactions. We employ the data in May for our research. Following [9,10], we use the most recent fractions 1/64 and 1/4 of the training sequences of Yoochoose as the dataset Yoochoose 1/64 and Yoochoose 1/4. For a fair comparison, following [9,26], we rst ltered out all sessions of length≤2 and items appearing less than 5 times in all datasets. Then we applied a data augmentation technique described in [20]. For each dataset, we select about 20% as the test set, 10% as valid set and remaining 70% as training set. It is worth mentioning that there are no duplicate records for same items with dierent interaction types, i.e., the purchase behavior after the click interaction with same item is treated as purchase this item without the prior record of click behavior. The statistics of all datasets after prepossessing are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Statistics of datasets use d in experiments. 5.1.2 Baseline Models. To demonstrate MGCNet’s superiority performance, we compared it with the following representative methods for MBSBR: • GRU4Rec[7] utilized the GRU to capture the representation of the item sequence. • NARM[9] adopted RNN to encode the item representation and an attention mechanism based on last item to capture the sequential feature. • SRGNN[26] utilized GGNN to capture the item transition patterns and generated the session representation based on the attention module. • LESSR[2] proposed to learn the item embeddings from an edge-order preserving graph and a shortcut graph iteratively based on current session. • MGNN-SPred[24] converted sequences into a global itemitem graph and exploited the GNNs to learn item representations, and integrated dierent behavior session representations by the gating mechanism. • MBGCN[8] constructed a heterogeneous graph with useritem and item-item relations to model multi-behavior interactions. • MKM-SR[11] employed GGNN to encode the item transitions and RNN to encode the behavior feature separately. A session representation was learnt by the attention mechanism based on the combination of the above two features. For original GRU4Rec, NARM, SRGNN, and LESSR methods, they are developed for the common session-based recommendation, which only consider single click behavior. And multi-behavior based models like MGNN-SPred and MKM-SR, concentrate on next item prediction with specic target behavior based on historical multiplex interaction sequence. To make the comparison fairer, we revise these methods in the following manner. We use the original Table 2: Experimental results (%) of dierent models in terms of HR@20 and MRR@20 for dierent next behavior type session on three datasets. The * means the best results on baseline methods. Ours + GT forms to model the multi-behavior sequence with the input of item and behavior type simultaneously for RNN based models. For GNN based models, we additionally concatenate corresponding current behavior embedding with the item representation after GNN encoders. Here, we only employ the item-item GNN part of MBGCN and remove the user-related module following the denition of SBR, and reform the item-item edges with same behavior within one session. Moreover, we take all multiplex next behavior data for unied training. 5.1.3 Implementation Details. We implement the proposed model based on Pytorch and DGL. The item and behavior embedding dimension is set to 128 for all models. All parameters are initialized using a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.1. We use the Adam optimizer to train the models with the mini-batch size of 512. We conduct the grid search over hyperparameters as follows: learning rate𝜂in{0.001,0.01,0.1}, learning The hyper-parameter𝛾is set to 10 in{0.1,1, ,10,100}. About the hyper-parameters𝜆in loss function, we set{𝜆, 𝜆, 𝜆} = for two Yoochoose datasets based on the distributions of dierent next behavior types, separately. For the other baselines, in order to achieve the best performance for MBSBR, we tune the hyperparameters of these revised methods, with the same ranges of our tuning experiments. 5.1.4 Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate the performance of all models by employing the following widely used metrics: •Hit Ratio (HR@K) is widely used as a measure of predictive accuracy. It indicates the proportion of correctly recommended items among the top-𝐾 items. •Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@K) is the average of the reciprocal ranks of the target items. The reciprocal rank is set to zero if the rank exceeds 𝐾. For multiple next behavior data, we separately calculate the metrics with dierent next behavior type sessions, while train a uniform recommendation model for all kinds of next behavior. Table 3: The recall result(%) for various next behavior prediction of Task 2. DatasetClick Purchase Click Purchase Click Purchase Favorite The comparison results on three datasets are reported on Table 2. "Ours + GT" indicates our model for Task 1 with the given next behavior. We can obtain the following signicant observations. MGCNet comprehensively outperforms all baselines on all metrics for dierent behaviors. The results indicate that our model is eective to the MBSBR. • Our model can leverage the global graph for session recommendation eciently.At the multi-behavior category, MGCNet outperforms global graph based MGNNSPred and adapted MBGCN in all metrics with dierent next behavior types. This demonstrates the strong power of behavioral contextual aware item representation layer, since global intention and local interest are integrated into nal item representation, which empowers the eectiveness of representation learning for MBSBR. However, MGNN-SPred and adapted MBGCN fail to leverage local intention signals for item representation. • Our model achieves competitive performance among the multi-behavior based approaches.Comparing with the multi-behavior based models such as MGNN-SPred, MKMSR, our MGCNet performs the best. For MGNN-SPred, it leverages the multiplex behavior data simplistically, which may lead to the information loss in original data. For MKMSR, it only encodes the behavior sequence independently but ignores the contribution of corresponding items. Meanwhile, all the above methods ignore the potential relation between next behavior and historical operation sessions. In contrast, MGCNet can extract intention strength and semantic relation of interest based on former interaction sequence and next behavior intention, which strongly improves the model eectiveness. Moreover, Table 3 represents the next behavior prediction result for Task 2, measured with recall metrics on various target behavior sessions. Compared with the results of "Ours" and "Ours + GT", we nd that the ground truth behavior information oered in Task 1 can oer more accurate intention information than the forecasted behavior tag, which suggests that a better grasp of the next behavior will make better guidance for the next item prediction. In this subsection, we conduct some ablation studies on the proposed model to investigate the eectiveness of behavior information and some module designs. Table 4: The performance comparison w.r.t dierent information on Tmall. NARM-Single 30.62 13.41 55.72 31.29 32.73 15.04 NARM-Multi 30.80 13.68 56.16 31.73 33.18 15.32 LESSR-Single 31.49 14.47 58.22 34.57 34.44 16.82 Ours w/o Next 32.17 14.72 60.29 37.83 35.62 16.70 5.3.1 Impact of behavior information. We compare our model with several representative baselines in Table 4 to test whether considering multiplex behavior sequence indeed boosts the performance of SBR. The methods with “(-Single)" mean considering multiplex interaction types as single type from their full version, while "(Multi)" is the multi-behavior based version. By comparing each method in Table 4 with two versions, we nd each method with multi-behavior information beats single behavior based model in most metrics on Tmall dataset. Based on the above illustrations, we demonstrate that considering the multiplex behavior interaction sequence is indeed meaningful. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies of our model with various next behavior information. "Ours w/o Next" indicates the loss the next interaction type prediction in our model. The advantage of "Ours + GT" and "Ours" over "Ours w/o Next" shows that the next behavior type deserves to be incorporated for SBR. 5.3.2 Impact of dierent Layers. In this part, we compare our method with dierent variants to verify the eectiveness of the critical components of MGCNet. Specically, we remove critical modules of MGCNet to observe changes in model performance, using "w/o Global Graph" to denote removing the global heterogeneous graph encoder, and using "w/o BCIRL" to denote skipping the Behavioral contextual aware item representation learning layer. Table 5: The performance comparison w.r.t. dierent module design on Tmall. Model settingHR MRR HR MRR HR MRR w/o Current attention 32.14 14.73 60.36 36.95 36.41 17.27 w/o General attention 31.67 14.29 61.90 38.71 36.84 17.77 Figure 3: Performance comparison w.r.t. the max session length. Figure 4: Performance comparison w.r.t. 𝛽 and GNN layers. The experimental results are presented in Table 5. It can be observed that the item representations of the global graph are pivotal for the model performance by seeing "w/o Global Graph". For the session intention modeling, the removal of general attention module leads to a greater impact on results than the current attention module, which demonstrates that long-term user preference is still valuable for SBR. In summary, we can infer that the key components of MGCNet are eective through the above comparison and analysis. In this subsection, we perform experiments to explore how the hyper-parameters like GNN layers and intention factor𝛽inuence the model performance. 5.4.1 Impact of maximum session length. In this part, we discuss how the performance changes with hyper-parameter maximum session length𝑀, which indicates the upper limits of historical information that the network can utilize to make predictions for current session. Figure 3 shows the evaluation results with dierent maximum session lengths in the range from 1 to 12. HR@20 reaches the highest score when𝑀is 8 for Tmall. Overall, our model outperforms MKM-SR consistently. As expected, with larger maximum sequence length at the beginning, the performance of both our model and MKM-SR grows to be better. That show eectiveness of sequence information for learning current user interest. In general, we can nd that longer session does not lead to better performance, which indicates that the increase of current session length does not necessarily lead to an increase in model performance. 5.4.2 Impact of Depth of GNN. We test dierent depth settings about graph representation propagation. The depth setting with value 0 indicates that our model does not use multi-relation GNN and only learns the item representation based on the naive item embedding. Figure 4 shows the corresponding results. We can see that the performance of depth 0 is worse than multi-layers of GNN. This comparison claries the signicance of considering the global item and behavior transitions for our model. Moreover, the performance declines when the depth grows from 1 to 3, showing the overly depth of GNN layers will lead to over-smooth problem and make the item representation less distinguishable, which is not ideal for further improving the performance. 5.4.3 Impact of Intention Factor. We investigate the inuence of relevant local intention to item nal by intention factor𝛽for session recommendation at Item Representation Learning module. Fig. 4 visualizes MGCNet’s HR@20 scores in Tmall, from which we nd that MGCNet’s performance varies marginally (∼1%) when𝛽is set in[0.05, 0.1]. What’s more, the performance of MGCNet achieves the peak when𝛽 =0.1, and sharply drops when𝛽 ≥0.1, which implies that overweight assigned with local intention may disturb the session representation for MBSBR. In this work, due to the limitations of the existing tasks, we propose two more realistic and reasonable tasks for MBSBR. To address the above tasks, we develop a Multi-behavior Graph Contextual Aware Network (MGCNet), which explicitly utilizes the next behavior and integrates item representation of global transitions overall sessions and local intention based on current session for better session recommendation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model. In the future, we plan to explore the ne-grained intent of dierent interaction behaviors within the current session. We also plan to introduce more side information, such as time, brand information of items, etc.
