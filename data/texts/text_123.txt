Background: Despite the significant advances in life science, it still takes decades to translate a basic drug  discovery into a cure for human disease. To accelerate the process from “bench-to-bedside”, interdisciplinary  research (especially research involving both basic research and clinical research) has been strongly recommend  by many previous studies. However, the patterns and the roles of the interdisciplinary characteristics in drug  research have not been deeply examined in extant studies.  Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize interdisciplinarity in drug research from the perspective  of  translational  science,  and  to  examine  the  role  of  different  kinds  of  interdisciplinary  characteristics  in  translational research for drugs.   Methods: In this paper, we analyze the interdisciplinary of drug research from a novel bibliometric perspective,  i.e., a translational science perspective. 18 FDA approved drugs belonging to 6 categories are used as the research  proxies. We propose four bibliometric indicators (i.e., Diversity of Research, Symmetry of Research, Persistence  of Research and Stability of Research) for characterizing interdisciplinarity in drug research at both the macro  and micro levels. We also design a bibliometric indicator (i.e., Translation Intensity) for quantifying the result  of  a  drug’s  translation.  Correlation  analysis  was  also  used  to  examine  the  relationships  between  these  interdisciplinary characteristics of drug research and the translation intensity of drugs.  Results: Multidisciplinary research (especially the research involving both basic and clinical disciplines) is still  rare for all the 18 drugs and they generally occurred later than intra-disciplinary research in the timelines of drug  research. The four interdisciplinary characteristics of drug research and the translation intensity of drugs both  vary according to drugs.  At the macro level, the  diversity and symmetry  of  research have evident positive  relationships with the translation intensity of drugs. At the micro level, the persistence of all seven kinds of  research positively correlated with the translation intensity of drugs; and the persistence of multidisciplinary  research  have  stronger  relationships  with  the  translation  intensity  of  drugs  than  those  of  intra-disciplinary  research except for the research within the cell/molecular discipline (CC research), which showed the most  impressive correlations with the translation intensity of drugs. In addition, the stability of all kinds of research  did not show a significant influence on the translation intensity of drugs.  Conclusions: Interdisciplinary research engaging both basic science and clinical science should be encouraged  in translational research for drugs. The basic research within the cell/molecular discipline needs more persistence  to shorten the translational lags in drug research. Moreover, the methodology in this paper showcases a feasible  way to characterize interdisciplinarity of research and measure the results of translation in drug research, and it  can be adopted and improved for other domains, such as vaccine, medical devices.  In spite of ongoing advances in science and technology, it has taken significantly longer than expected for a  basic drug discovery to be translated into a treatment for human diseases. Only around 0.1% of the new drug  candidates can finally receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with a cost of $2.6  billion for each approved drug. Almost 90% of the drug candidates failed before they ever tested in human trials,  which is known as “the valley of death”; and around 50% of the drugs that have entered into clinical trials died  in their phase III trials (Li et al., 2020; Seyhan, 2019). The failure rate of clinical trials of drugs has actually  increased over recent years despite the increasing predictability of tests on cell/molecular or animal models  (Leenaars et al., 2019). The main reasons are inadequate effectiveness or badly side effects (Waring et al., 2015).  Therefore, it is crucial to improve the success rate of the translation of drugs and cut down the translation lags  (Ogier et al., 2019; Parrish et al., 2019).   Most of the previous studies on translational research for drugs have focused on the roadblocks hindering  the  success  of  “bench-to-bedside”  translation,  such  as  insufficient  research  funding  (Hörig  et  al.,  2005),  imperfect reward system (Fishburn, 2013), knowledge gap between basic and clinical scientists (Rocca, 2017),  misuse of statistical methods (Vidgen & Yasseri, 2016), difficulty in cohort recruitment (Segura-Bedmar & Raez,  2019),  irreproducibility  of  basic  experiments  (Jarvis  & Williams,  2016),  and  insufficient  understanding  of  translational  science  (Seyhan,  2019).  To  clear these roadblocks, interdisciplinary research,  especially those  involving both basic and clinical science, has been highly recommended as one of the solutions to accelerate  drug translation (Ameredes et al., 2015; Bahney et al., 2016; Rocca, 2017). On the one hand, drug translation is  an intricate task that requires a range of diverse skills, such as pharmacology, epidemiology, statistics, genetics,  clinical  studies and  computer  science  (Kumar  & Sattigeri,  2018).  Interdisciplinary  research  has shown  the  effectiveness to breed and amplify innovations during the process of translation (Xu et al., 2015) and improve  the  quality  and  reproducibility  of  research  (Barba,  2016),  by  allowing  scientists  in  various  disciplines  to  exchange  innovative  ideas  and  share  their  resources  and  experience  (C.  Zhang  et  al.,  2018).  Moreover,  interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers from various organizations including funding agencies and  government departments bring more funding and higher clinical impact to translational research (Gil-Garcia et  al., 2019). But on the other hand, other studies have indicated several drawbacks of interdisciplinary research  and collaborations for translational medicine, such as communication gaps (Grippa et al., 2018), time-consuming  (Bu, Ding, Xu, et al., 2018), leadership (Folkman et al., 2019), and intellectual barriers (Banner et al., 2019).  Establishing a persistent and stable interdisciplinary research team is definitely a challenge (Seyhan, 2019).   Hence, interdisciplinary research arguably plays many roles in the translation of drug discoveries, yet it has  been a subject of few quantitative studies in the translational research for drugs. Besides, previous studies on  interdisciplinary  research  focused  mainly  on  the  perspectives  of  journals  (L.  Zhang  et  al.,  2016),  articles  (Leydesdorff & Ivanova, 2021), and authors (Bu, Ding, Xu, et al., 2018). However, in the process of translating  drug discoveries into therapies, there is a variety of research types. In particular, the biomedical studies can be  classified into seven different categories by using the translational triangle of biomedicine originally proposed  by (Weber, 2013): animal related research (A), cell/molecular related research (C) and human related research  (H) and the combinations of these three (i.e., AC, AH, CH, ACH). In this paper, we divided drug research into  the corresponding seven categories: (1) A-A; (2) C-C; (3) H-H; (4) A-C; (5) A-H; (6) C-H; and (7) A-C-H. (1),  (2) and (4) are research within basic science; (3) research within clinical science; (5), (6) and (7) are research  involving both basic science and clinical science. To our best  knowledge, the patterns  and the roles of the  different kinds of research in translational process for drugs, which can provide us insights on how to shorten  the translation lags in drug research and development, have not been deeply examined in the extant studies. For  example, would more persistent and stable interdisciplinary research involving both basic science and clinical  science lead to better results in the translation of drugs? The more diverse the research, the more likely the  translation of drugs will be successful?   To analyze these patterns and roles, in this paper, we first characterized the patterns of interdisciplinarity in  translational  research  for  drugs  at  both  the  macro  and  micro  levels.  Specifically,  for  the  macro  level,  we  employed the entropy concept to quantify the diversity of drug research by treating the relationships between  research categories and the related articles of a drug as a bipartite graph (Corrêa Jr. et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2019).  Then, the normalization of the diversity of research was used to calculate how the evenness of the distribution  of different categories of drug research is, that is, the symmetry of research. For the micro level, we further  extended two  bibliometric  indicators  originally proposed for  measuring the  persistence and  stability of  the  collaboration between an author pair  by (Bu, Ding, Liang, et al., 2018; Bu, Murray, Ding,  et al., 2018), to  quantify the persistence and stability of each category of drug research.    To examine the role of different kinds of  research in translational process of drugs,  in this paper, we  proposed a bibliometric indicator (translation intensity) to quantify the result of a drug’s translation, which is  based on the approximate potential to translate of a biomedical article proposed by (Hutchins et al., 2019). Then,  correlation  analyses  (including  Pearson  and  Spearman  correlation  analysis)  were  used  to  explore  how  the  aforementioned  interdisciplinary  characteristics  of  different  drug  research  had  influenced  the  translational  intensity of drugs.    We selected 18 approved drugs from the FDA website (http://fda.gov/Drugs) as the research proxies. These  drugs belong to 6 different drug classes, which are common and well-studied (Kissin & Bradley, 2012). Each  drug class includes one first-in-class drug (FICD) and two follow-on drugs (FOD) since it is  significant to  identify the differences in the patterns  between  real  drug breakthroughs  and  the follow-on  drugs (Kissin &  Bradley, 2012).   Interdisciplinary research, which integrates ideas, methods, techniques, theories, or knowledge from multiple  disciplines (Rosenfield, 1992), has been considered to have a high probability of success. Understanding how  interdisciplinary  research  affects  scientific  success  can  be  enhanced  by  measuring  and  analyzing  the  interdisciplinarity of scientific research (Leydesdorff & Ivanova, 2021). Diversity, evenness and disparity are  considered as three main dimensions of  interdisciplinarity  of research (L. Zhang et al., 2016). Specifically,  diversity (also called variety) measures how many categories of disciplines there are in a study. In bibliometrics,  the predefined disciplinary categories, such as the Leuven-Budapest subject classification system, the subject  categories in Web of Science or Elsevier, has been used for calculating the diversity of research or journals, from  the perspectives of citation or collaboration. Meanwhile, with the development of text mining techniques such  as topic modeling, entity extraction and text clustering, the research topics, the specialty of authors has also been  counted to represent the diversity of research (Bu et al., 2018). The interdisciplinary score of a research gets  higher if the measurement object is more diverse in the categories. Although simple and clear, these indicators  suffer from the redundant classification system, the synonyms of entities, and inaccurate topic clustering (Zuo  & Zhao, 2018). From the perspective of networks, the between centrality has been calculated in co-citation  networks  and co-author  networks  to measure the diversity  of  research or  journals  (L.  Zhang et al., 2016).  However,  these  methods  considered  only  the  topological  information  of  networks  and  ignored  the  nodal  information. Besides, the diversity of research has also been examined from other perspectives, such as different  regions, different h-index, different countries and different term functions (Bu, Ding, Xu, et al., 2018; Lu et al.,  2019).  Evenness (also called balance or symmetry) measures how much of each category of discipline there is in  a research. The evenness has a positive relationship with the diversity, that is, the more even the evenness, the  higher the diversity. In fact, evenness and diversity are often treated as a “dual-concept” index, and the evenness  of research was always calculated by the normalization of the diversity (Leydesdorff & Ivanova, 2021). For  example, Corrêa Jr. et al. (2017) and Lu et al. (2019) employed the Shannon’s entropy to normalize the diversity  of author contributions and keyword term function for their calculating the evenness. Except for the Shannon’s  entropy, the Gini index and Simpson index have also been used for capturing the evenness in previous studies  (L. Zhang et al., 2016). Finally, disparity quantifies how different from each other are the disciplinary categories  in a research. It also has a positive relationship with the diversity. The Rao-Stirling diversity index was a typical  measure for the disparity based on network structure. However, it was demonstrated to be not convincing for  measuring the interdisciplinarity of  journals by  (Leydesdorff  & Rafols, 2011) and (Zhou et al., 2012). The  distance of disciplines that were operationalized by the cosine distance of topic terms or texts was also employed  to quantify the disparity. For example, (Bromham et al., 2016) developed a co-classification-based indicator to  measure the disparity. In the citation or collaboration networks, the shortest distances between nodes are also  used for quantifying the disparity.   In this paper, at the macro level, we mainly discuss the diversity and the symmetry of research for the  translation of drugs. Specifically, for a specific drug, we employ a Shannon entropy diversity (i.e., the true  diversity) based on a bipartite graph that links the research categories to the drug’s articles list, to quantify the  diversity of research of the drug. Then the normalization of the diversity can be used to measure the symmetry  of research of the drug, which indicates how even the drug research is. We choose this method because the  similar bibliometric indicators have been successfully used for measuring the diversity and symmetry of the  contributions of authors (Leydesdorff & Ivanova, 2021) and the term function of author keywords (Lu et al.,  2019).   At the micro level, we also use two indicators (including the persistence of research and the stability of  research) to analyze the patterns and the roles of interdisciplinary research in drug research.  In the previous  studies, Bu et al. (2018) proposed two bibliometric indicators, i.e., the Persistent Scientific Collaboration (based  on the intervals and the skip years without collaborations) and the Stability of Collaboration (based on the yearto year publication output of collaborations), to measure the persistence and stability of collaborations for an  author  pair over  time.  The results  of their  studies on a  large-scale  dataset demonstrated the reliability and  effectiveness of the two indicators (Bu, Ding, Liang, et al., 2018; Bu, Murray, Ding, et al., 2018). Therefore, in  this paper, we replace the publication output of a specific author pair with the publication output of the specific  category of research for a drug, and used the intervals and skip years without the specific category research (the  Persistence of the Research) and the year-to-year publication output of the specific category of research (the  Stability  of  Research)  to  quantify  the  persistence  and  stability  of  different  categories  of  drug  research,  respectively.  Translational  research  for  drugs  (also  known  as  translational  pharmacology)  is  defined  as  the  process  of  translating the drug discoveries in laboratory into clinical applications for human diseases (Kumar & Sattigeri,  2018). Despite the significant investment in drug research, research findings at molecular or animal levels are  far from being fully translated to patient level (Contopoulos-Ioannidis et al., 2008; Madlock-Brown & Eichmann,  2015; Seyhan, 2019). Much of recent studies on translational pharmacology have been focused on identifying  the key factors affecting this bench-to-bedside process (Rocca, 2017; Segura-Bedmar & Raez, 2019; Seyhan,  2019; Stubbs & Uzuner, 2019). For examples, Ioannidis (2016) systematically analyzed the reason for “useless  clinical studies” and pointed out that a number of research findings published in medical journals are not robust  as the authors has claimed and can’t be reproduced mainly because of their poor study design. Fajardo-Ortiz et  al. (2014) explored how the structure of knowledge of research teams affects the translation of a cancer drug  (liposomal  doxorubicin).  Seyhan  (2019)  reviewed  the  challenges  facing  translational  pharmacology  and  suggested that a number of “culprits” lead to “the lost in translation”, such as inappropriate research hypothesis,  irreproducibility  of  biomedical  studies,  misuse  of  statistical  methods  (i.e.,  p-value),  and  insufficient  understanding of translational science. Agache et al. (2019) found that insufficient research funding and the  reward mechanism were also important factors hindering the translation of drugs in the field of allergy. Dueñas  et al. (2016) considered that most of the NIH funding often funds the small studies because they can be finished  in a short time and get results published rapidly, while long-term studies with large patient cohorts sometimes  can’t  be  conduct  because  of  insufficient  resources  available  to  the  scientists.  Almost  all  these  studies  recommended that interdisciplinary research, especially those involving both basic science and clinical science,  should be encouraged to accelerate the “bench to bedside” process. These studies, however, were generally based  on  the  qualitative  analysis  or  manually  systematic  review.  They  have  not  yet  to  attempted  to  address  the  translational roadblocks by improving our understanding of the relationships between the interdisciplinarity of  drug research and the translation of drugs.  With the advances in data availability and text analysis technologies, literature-based translational research in  biomedicine has also become a popular subject in the field of  bibliometrics and health informatics. Natural  language processing has facilitated these bibliometric studies by enabling biomedical entity recognition (Xu et  al., 2020), entity relationship reasoning (Lee et al., 2019) and entitymetrics (Li et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2021), etc.  Researchers have also explored how to assess or track the translational progress of biomedical studies using  automated literature mining. For example, Lewison and Paraje (2004) employed the clue words in the article  titles to distinguish “basic” journals from “clinical” journals. Tijssen (2010) proposed a knowledge utilization  triangle  and  classified  the  journals  into  six  application  domains  according  to  their  application  orientation.  However, these studies were not enough to represent the translational progress of articles. To go further, Boyack  et al. (2014) trained a used a logistic regression model with article titles, abstracts and references to group more  than 25 million articles from Scopus into different research levels. Meanwhile, MeSH terms indexed by experts  have been widely used for tracking translational research. For example, Petersen et al. (2016) proposed a triple  helix framework based on the “C”, “D” and “E” groups of MeSH terms to describe the evolution of research  focus  over  time.  Weber  (2013)  developed  a  biomedicine  triangle  to  identify  translational  science  in  three  dimensions (i.e., “animal”, “cell/molecular” and “human”). In addition, Hutchins et al. (2019) combined weber’s  biomedicine triangle and citation network information to predict the translational progress of biomedical studies  from the perspective of knowledge flow. They pointed out that distinct knowledge pathways are significantly  associated with the success of translation.   In this step, we first selected drugs for the analysis from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website  (http://fda.gov/Drugs) based on two criteria: (a) drugs had to have been well-studied and approved by the FDA  between the 1960’s and 2000’s; (b) each drug category had to have three (1 first-in-class and 2 follow-on) drugs  included. Finally, 18 drugs belonging to 6 categories were selected: (1) angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  (ACEIs ), including captopril, enalopril and moexipril; (2) beta blockers (propranolol, atenolol and bisoprolol);  (3) proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), containing omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole; (4) statins (lovastatin,  simvastatin,  and  pitavastatin);  (5)  triptans  (sumatriptan,  almotriptan,  and  frovatriptan);  and  (6)  nucleoside  reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), including zidovudine, lamivudine, and emtricitabine.  To obtain the related articles for these drugs, we downloaded over 30 million PubMed articles in XML  format in August 2021. For each article, we extracted the bibliographic information such as title, abstract, MeSH  terms and publication time using a dom4j-based XML parsing script. We next employed BioBERT (Lee et al.,  2019), a biomedical language model pretrained on PubMed and PubMed Central, to extract biomedical entities  (drugs) from the titles and abstracts. For each recognized drug entity, we assigned it a unique entity id with a  multi-type biomedical entity normalization tool based on probability decision rules (Kim et al., 2019). 146,663  articles regarding these 18 drugs were finally filtered as research dataset and stored in a local MySQL database.    To track drugs along the translational continuum using aforementioned articles, it is crucial to distinguish  basic articles from clinical articles. In this paper, we classified articles into Animal (A) related, Molecule/Cell  (C) related, Human (H) related and combinations of these three (i.e., AC, AH, CH and ACH) using the MeSH  terms assigned (Weber, 2013). Specifically, terms with MeSH codes starting with subcategory code A11, B02,  B03, B04, G02.111.570 or G02.149 are C terms; terms with MeSH codes starting with subcategory code M01  or  B01.050.150.900.649.801.400.112.400.400  are  H  terms;  and  terms  with  MeSH  codes  beginning  with  subcategory code B01 except for B01.050.150.900.649.801.400.112.400.400 are A terms. Each article could  have one or more of the three kinds of MeSH terms, or none of the three (Hutchins et al., 2019; Weber, 2013).  According to the article type, we divided research of drugs into 7 categories, i.e., AA, CC, and AC (research  within  basic science); HH  (research  within clinical science);  CH, AH  and ACH  (interdisciplinary research  involving both basic science and clinical science). The details on the research dataset are shown in Table 1.   In order to explicitly understand the interdisciplinarity in drug translational research, for each drug, we  searched the  PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Derwent Innovation Index for the year of the  earliest articles with different research types, the year of the first FDA approval, and the year of the first awarded  patent. We also searched the Wikipedia and DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2018) to cross-verified this information,  which are used to form the timelines of milestones for the 18 drugs. Finally, these information are mapped onto  the Triangle of Biomedicine (Hutchins et al., 2019; Weber, 2013) for analysis.   In this section, we propose four indicators to quantitatively characterize interdisciplinarity of drug research from  the perspective of translational science, that is, the diversity of research (D ), the symmetry of research (S ), the  persistence of research (P ), and the stability of research (ST ). The D and S measure the diversity and  evenness of the distribution of research of a given drug d at the macro level, respectively; while the P and  ST quantify  the  persistence  and  stability  of  a  kind  of  research  c  (   )  of  a given drug  d  at  the  micro  level.  The  detailed explanations for  these  indicators are as follows.   Diversity  of  research  (D ).  To  quantify  the  diversity  of  research  of  a  drug  from  the  perspective  of  translational science, for each drug, the relationship among related articles and their research categories is treated  as a bipartite graph (Corrêa Jr. et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2019), which is a graph with edges linked only among  nodes belonging to two distinct groups. As illustrated in Figure 2, the bipartite graph derived from each drug  establishes edges between drug related articles and their possible research categories. Each article is linked to  one research category, while one research category can have multiple articles assigned.     For  a  specific  research  category    , its  strength  in  the  research of a drug,  , is given by:  where   denotes the relationship between the research category  and the i-th article in the research of a drug,  i.e., if the research category of i-th article is ,  ; else,  . Meanwhile, according to the research  type  of  each  article,  we  use  the  weight   to  represent  its  importance  to  the  drug  research,  i.e.,  if  ,  ; if ,   else,   Notably, the range of   is from  0 to 1, and we can use the entropy concept to quantify the diversity of the distribution of the different categories  of research for a drug (Corrêa Jr. et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2019). Thus, for a given drug , the diversity of its  research,  , is expressed as:   Symmetry of research (S ) for a specific drug d means the evenness of the distribution of the strength for  different categories of research of a drug. In this paper, we use the normalization of the diversity of research ( to calculate how even the research of the drug (Corrêa Jr. et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2019). Therefore, for a given  drug , the symmetry of its research,   is calculated as:  where     denotes the number of the categories of research of a drug.   measures  the symmetry of research of a drug and it ranges between 0 and 1. If different categories of research occur equally  for a drug,   will reach its maximum value, i.e.,  .   From the translational science perspective, we extend the two author-level bibliometric indicators (i.e., the  degree of PSC and the stability of scientific collaboration) originally proposed by Bu et al. (Bu, Ding, Liang, et  al., 2018; Bu, Murray, Ding, et al., 2018), to quantify the persistence and stability of the 7 kinds of drug research.    Persistence  of  research  (P )  is  defined  as  the  continuity  of  a  specific  category  of  research       of  a  given drug .  We  calculate   by  considering  the  number of years without  research and whether these years are adjacent or not. Specifically, for a given drug ,  we  assume  that  the  total  number  of   research  in   years  is   ,  and  we  use  a  vector        to  represent  the  yearly  number  of   research  among   -year  time,  in  which   . We then define   () based on three criteria, i.e.,   have to (1) be a consecutive subvector of   ; (2) contain  components (); (3) cater to the following restrictions (   ):  The translation of a drug is a reiterative and continuous process (Seyhan, 2019). Many basic drug discoveries,  such as captopril, aspirin and metformin (Spector et al., 2018), have been successfully translated to more than  one human diseases. Hence, in this paper, we propose an indicator (i.e., translation intensity) to quantify the  translation result of the whole research process of a drug, not limited to the first translation.      Translation Intensity (TI ) measures the intensity to translate for the research of a drug. For a given drug   with  related articles in PubMed during the period of Y years, we employ the approximate  potential to  translate (), a machine-learning based indicator that measures the probability for an article to be cited in  later clinical trials or guidelines (Hutchins et al., 2019), to quantify the translation intensity of each article related  to  the  drug  .  The  APT  of  each  article  in  PubMed  can  be  freely  obtained  from  the  iCite  website  (https://icite.od.nih.gov/api) hosted by the NIH. Thus, the translation intensity of the drug ,  , is expressed  as:  In this paper, we investigate the interdisciplinarity in drug research from the translational science perspective.  Using 18 FDA approved drugs as research proxies, we first examine the first years of different kinds of research,  the translation lag and the distribution of different kinds of research mapped onto the Triangle of Biomedicine  from  a  bird’s eye. Then, with the indicators proposed in this paper, we conduct descriptive analysis on the  distribution patterns of the interdisciplinary characteristics of drug research, including the diversity of research,  the  symmetry  of  research,  the  persistence  of  research  and  the  stability  of  research.  We  also  describe  the  distribution of the translation intensity of the 18 drugs. The differences in these indicators are compared between  all drugs, the first-in-class and the follow-on drugs as well as the 6 drug categories. Finally, we employ both the  Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis to analyze the relationships between the translation intensity of drug  and the interdisciplinary characteristics of drug research.  The median of  the translation lags (Contopoulos-Ioannidis et  al., 2008) for the  18  drugs from the earliest  PubMed  article or  patent to  their  first FDA approval is  14  years (interquartile  range, 7  to  17 years),  with  essentially no difference between the first-in-class drugs and the follow-on drugs. In fact, the actual translation  lag could be longer because of technical protection and trade secrets by pharmaceutical companies. For example,  captopril was originally synthesized in 1975, but until 1977, it was first awarded patent; and until 1978, the first  article  on  captopril was  recorded  in  the PubMed.  This indicates  the  long length of  time  to translate  basic  discoveries into clinical applications of drugs, which confirms the findings of (Spector et al., 2018) and (Weber,  2013).    Figure 3 shows the first research of different categories, the first patents and the first FDA approvals along  the timelines of the 18 drugs, which reveals three important findings. First, in drug research, intra-disciplinary  research (e.g., AA and HH) occurred much earlier than interdisciplinary research involving both basic science  and clinical science, such as AH, CH or ACH. Frequently, multidisciplinary research (ACH) appeared later than  the first FDA approval of the drug, for examples, the beta blockers, the triptans and the NRTIs. Second, the  sequences of first research in the timelines vary according to drugs. For instance, the first CC research of three  triptans  appeared  at  the  last  place  of  their  timelines,  while  that  of  lamivudine  ranked  the  first  place.  The  differences among categories are larger than these of drugs in the same drug category. These differences in the  structures of research among drugs may be caused by the intellectual structure and research progress of different  drugs. Third, there is no significant difference in patterns between the first-in-class drugs and the follow-on drug.     In Figure 4 and Figure 5, we mapped different categories of research of the 18 drugs during 1950-2018  from the perspective of translational science using the Triangle of Biomedicine originally proposed by Weber  (2013) and modified by Hutchins et al. (2019), in which the three dimensions (Animal, Cell/molecular, and  Human) were scored into a Cartesian coordinate system and the research (articles) were represented by circles.  The colors filled in circles vary according to the categories of research; the size of circles can reflect the number  of studies (articles) sharing the same coordinate; and the location of a circle can indicate the A-C-H composition  of the research of the drug. More details on the Triangle of Biomedicine can be found in (Hutchins et al., 2019;  Weber, 2013).   We note several general patterns when observing the distribution of research mapped onto the Triangle of  Biomedicine in Figure 4 and Figure 5. First, for intra-disciplinary research, the total amount of HH research,  whose mean percentage in all 18 drugs is 49.74% (interquartile range, 38.7% to 56.6%), possesses an absolute  advantage over that of AA and CC research in all drugs. Nevertheless, knowledge discovered in basic science  typically did not directly flows into human trials (Narin et al., 1976; Weber, 2013), which means discoveries in  fundamental research was not successfully translated into clinical applications.  Second,  the total number of  interdisciplinary research, especially for the research involving both basic science and clinical science (e.g.,  ACH), are much less than the intra-disciplinary research in drug research. Specifically, the total number of ACH  research has been always ranking the last place for all drugs, and that of AH research is a clear second to the last.  Besides, we also find that A and C are dominated in ACH research for all drugs when observing the positions of  ACH research in the triangle.  of the follow-on drugs with the same drug category. This could be because the follow-on drugs “stand on the  shoulders” of the first-in-class drugs and share progresses unveiled in the previous research of the first-in-class  drugs. In addition, we can also find that the distributions of research for the first-in-class drugs are much more  diverse.           The  aforementioned observations raise questions about  the relationships between  the interdisciplinary  characteristics  of  research  and  the  translational  research of  drugs.  For  example,  multidisciplinary  research  involving both basic science and clinical science could play a role in translational research for drugs through  interdisciplinary ideas, resource sharing, science communication, talent training. Therefore, in the following  sections, we further quantified the diversity, the symmetry, the persistence and the stability of research for drugs  from  the  perspective  of  translational  science,  and  we  also  examined  the  relationships  between  these  four  indicators with the translation intensity of the 18 drugs.  Diversity of research  To explore how interdisciplinarity vary in drug research, we employed “diversity of research” (D ) as a measure  of the variability, as described in the methodology section. As shown in Figure 6, the red bars denote the diversity  of research observed in the 18 drugs, with the grey bars as the reference when the category of research is ignored  (i.e.,   constantly equals to 1). We can make three observations. First, the diversity of research (D ) varies  according to drugs (mean, 4.33; and interquartile range, from 3.32 to 5.32). Specifically, the D of propranolol  (5.85) is highest among these 18 drugs, captopril (5.80) is a clear second, and moexipril (2.14) ranks at the last  place. Second, the diversity of research (D ) has a relative strong correlation with the drug category. The mean  value of D of Beta blockers (5.25) is much higher than Triptans (3.10). Third, the D of the first-in-class drugs  possess a significant advantage over the follow-on drugs across all six categories of drugs, confirming that the  structures of research of the first-in-class drugs are much diverse than the follow-on drugs. Besides, all the  deviations  from  the  reference  of  the  D for  all  drugs  are  positive  (the  green  arrows),  indicating  that  interdisciplinary research contributes to the increase of diversity of drug research.  Symmetry of research  We examined the irregularity of research in drug research in terms of “symmetry of research” (S ). As illustrated  in Figure 7, we can find the corresponding value of S . The blue line represents the curve obtained by linking  the values denoting the average symmetry of research of each drug, and the red one is the reference line when  the category of research is ignored. Overall, the mean value of S  is 0.64 (interquartile range, from 0.45 to 0.76),  indicating a lack of evenness in drug research, especially for moexipril (0.32) and frovatriptan (0.43). Meanwhile,  the evenness of different categories of research in the first-in-class drugs is significantly better than the followon drugs in the same drug category by the value of S . However, PPIs is an exception, in which the S  of  pantoprazole (0.57) is slightly larger than omeprazole (0.54). Moreover, the values of S of all 18 drugs show a  clear advantage over the references represented by the orange lines, although the values of S vary according to  drugs. Similarly, this demonstrates that interdisciplinary research can enhance the evenness of drug research.  Persistence and stability of research  In this section, we visualized the persistence and the stability of different categories of research for the 18 drugs  using heatmaps. As shown in Figure 8a, the persistence of research of a given drug d is represented by a line  comprised of seven cells, whose values (c, P ) denote the value of the persistence (P ) of the c research of the  drug d. In our results, the degree of persistence for drugs is broad, ranging from 1.5 to 56. The colors of cells  reflect the degree of persistence of research (P ), that is, the higher the degree of P is, the color is redder; or,  the color will be bluer.    The visualization of persistence of drug research in Figure 8a led to several interesting findings. Overall, c  the research of the first-in-class drugs, whose names are in bold, is evidently persistent than that of the followon drugs. In particular, for ACE inhibitors, the mean persistence of seven categories of research of the first-inclass drug captopril is 40.29, while those of the follow-on drugs are much lower, for example, 23.14 for enalopril  and 10 for moexipril. As expected, the values of the persistence of research within disciplines (i.e., AA, CC and  HH) are significantly higher than the research involving both basic science and clinical science (i.e., AH, CH  and ACH). Furthermore, in research within disciplines, the persistence of AA or HH research has an advantage  over that of CC research. This indicates that animal trials and human trials are important  for the success of  translation for drugs, although they are difficult to succeed and time-consuming. In addition, it can be found that,  in most cases, the persistence of ACH research is the lowest compared to other six categories of research of the  same drug.        Similarly, as illustrated in Figure 8b, the stability of research of a given drug d is represented by a line  comprised of seven cells, whose values (c, ST ) denote the value of stability (ST ) of the c research of the drug  d. The heatmap shows that the values of ST  for the 18 drugs ranges from 0.68 to 1. The colors of cells represent  the degree of the stability of research.   Overall, the values of ST  of research within  disciplines (i.e., AA,  CC and  HH) possess an absolute  advantage over the research involving both basic science and clinical science (i.e., AH, CH, and ACH). However,  there are some exceptions, such as the stability of AA research of lansoprazole is the lowest (0.68), while that of  CH research of frovatriptan is the highest (1). This could because that the basic issues on these two follow-on  drugs have been well researched in the corresponding first-in-class drugs. Like the persistence of research, the  stability of ACH research evidently ranks at the last place, and that of HH research shows the absolute advantage.  However, there is no essential difference observed in the stability of research between the first-in-class drugs  and the follow-on drugs.   Translation Intensity  We quantified the translation intensity (TI ) by using the normalized sum of probabilities for all articles in the  research of a drug d to be cited in later clinical trials or guidelines. The results are shown in Figure 9, in which  the TI  of the first-in-class drugs is represented by the red bars for distinguishing from the follow-on drugs (in  black). The scale of translation intensity of the 18 drugs (mean, 60.2; interquartile range, from 19.64 to 91.67)  is also broad, ranging from 0.86 to 149.19.   Overall, the translation intensity of the 18 drugs varies according to drugs. Even for the drugs belonging to  the same categories, there are significant differences between them. For example, the values of the translation  intensity  (TI )  of  ACE  inhibitors  are 72.63  for  captopril, 67.41  for  enalopril  and  only  0.86  for  moexipril,  respectively. Meanwhile, one can observe that, the first-in-class drugs (in red) usually have higher translation  intensity values that surpassed the average level in most cases. This indicates that the research of the first-inclass drugs are more likely to be cited in clinical trials and guidelines, and they are easier translated into clinical  applications.           The aforementioned findings we observed in the descriptive analysis drive us to ask a question: what are  the  relationships  between  the  translation  intensity  and  the  interdisciplinary  characteristics  of  (diversity,  symmetry, persistence and stability) of drug research?     In this section, the translation intensity of drugs was measured with the characteristics of interdisciplinarity in  drug research. First, in terms of diversity of research (D ), as presented in Figure 10a and Table 2, the result of  correlation analysis  shows  a significant positive relationship between the diversity of research  (D ) and the  translation intensity (TI ): r  = 0.719, p = 0.000; r  = 0.764, p = 0.000.    Examining Figure 10b, we can observe that the value of translation intensity of drugs increases as the  symmetry of research in drug research increases, indicating that there is also a relative strong positive association  between the translation intensity (TI ) and the symmetry of research (S ) in drug research: r  = 0.677, p =  0.001; r  = 0.753, p = 0.001 (Table 2).     We then examined the translation intensity of drugs with the persistence (P ) of seven different categories  of drug research. As shown in Figure 11 and Table 3, there are significant positive relationships between the  translation intensity (TI ) and the P of all seven kinds of drug research. As expected, the strength of the positive  relationship between the translation intensity and the persistence of the ACH research is quite impressive: r = 0.807, p = 4.13*10 ; r  = 0.792, p = 0. 000. Notably, the persistence of the CC research has a significant  correlation with the translation intensity of drugs, with Pearson correlation coefficient high at 0.818 (p = 0.000)  and Spearman correlation coefficient high at 0.835 (p  = 5.7*10 ). Moreover, the relationships  between  the  translation intensity  of  drugs and the persistence of interdisciplinary  research (AC, AH, CH and  ACH) are  stronger than those between the translation intensity of drugs and the persistence of research within disciplines  (AA, CC and HH). In addition, the persistence of research involving both basic science and clinical science (AH,  CH and ACH) has a stronger relationship with the translation intensity than the interdisciplinary research within  basic science (AC). Eventually, when comparing the results in Table 2 and Table 3, we find that the persistence  of interdisciplinary research (AC, AH, CH and ACH) has stronger correlation with the translation intensity than  the diversity and the symmetry of research.  Figure 11. The relationship between the translation intensity of drugs and the persistence of drug research.   The relationships between the translation intensity of drugs and the stability (ST ) of seven different kinds  of drug research were finally explored, noted in Figure 12 and Table 3. We can see that, although there are trends  for positive relationships between the translation intensity and the stability of research, these relationships are  not statistically significant.   Figure 12. The relationship between the translation intensity of drugs and the stability of drug research.  Translational pharmacology is today playing an important role in drug development by linking basic discoveries  to clinical needs (Dolgos et al., 2016; Kumar & Sattigeri, 2018). In this paper, we analyze the interdisciplinarity  in  drug  research  from  a  novel  bibliometric  perspective,  i.e., the translational  science  perspective. 18  FDA  approved  drugs  belonging  to  6  categories  are  used  as  the  research  proxies.  Specifically,  we  propose  four  bibliometric indicators (i.e., the Diversity of Research, the Symmetry of Research, the Persistence of Research  and the Stability of Research) for characterizing interdisciplinarity in drug research at both the macro and the  micro levels. We also design a bibliometric indicator (i.e., Translation Intensity) for quantifying the degree of  clinical translation for drugs. We analyze the relationships between the interdisciplinary characteristics of drug  research and the translation intensity of drugs.  We find that it takes a long length of time to translate a laboratory discovery for human disease (Figure 3).  Interdisciplinary  research  involving  both  basic  science  and  clinical  science  have  been  suggested  in  many  previous studies to accelerate this process ( Banner et al., 2019; Kumar & Sattigeri, 2018; Seyhan, 2019);  however, they (especially ACH research) are still rare in the research of all the 18 drugs (Figure 4 and 5) and  they  generally  occurred  later  than  intra-disciplinary  research  in  the  timelines  (Figure  3).  Furthermore,  the  descriptive  analysis  indicates  that  the  interdisciplinary  characteristics  of  drug  research  and  the  translation  intensity of drugs both vary and show different patterns according to drugs (Figure 6, 7, 8, and 9), raising the  question  about  the  relationships  between  these  interdisciplinary  characteristics  of  drug  research  and  the  translation intensity of drugs. Correlation analyses show that several interdisciplinary characteristics of drug  research, such as the diversity of research and the persistence of ACH research, have significantly influenced  the translation of drugs.   Actually,  several  research in  scientometrics have demonstrated that  the importance  of  the  diversity  to  radical innovations, academic impact, and the success of scientific career (Amjad et al., 2017; Gil-Garcia et al.,  2019; Xu et al., 2015). High diverse research and collaborations can promote translational research because of  more financial support (Seyhan, 2019) as well as talents who come from various cultures, backgrounds and  experiences (Xu et al., 2015). We find that drugs whose research have higher diversity and symmetry are usually  those more successful drugs (i.e., the first-in-class drugs) with higher values of translational intensity, such as  propranolol and captopril, indicating that the diversity and symmetry of research have contributed to enhance  the translation of basic discoveries in drug research.   Another factor that has  influenced the translation intensity of drug  is the persistence of  research. The  persistence of all kinds of research has positive correlations with the translation intensity of  drugs,  and the  relationship between the CC research and the translation intensity is very impressive. These findings verify that  the old saying “success lies in perseverance” also applies to the field of drug research. The persistent efforts in  basic research at cell/molecular level is significant for the translation of drugs. Meanwhile, the persistence of  interdisciplinary research, especially those involving both basic and clinical science, have stronger relationships  with the translation intensity of drugs than those of intra-disciplinary research. This can be explained by the  finding of (Bu, Ding, Liang, et al., 2018; Bu, Ding, Xu, et al., 2018) that interdisciplinary research needs a high  degree  of persistence  to  generate  high-impact  outputs,  while the  intra-disciplinary  research  requires  only  a  moderate degree of persistence.             We find that the stability of research did not show a significant influence on the translation intensity of  drugs. Compared with the persistence of research, the stability of research puts more emphasis on the changes  of the number of research over time in drug research (Bu, Murray, Ding, et al., 2018; Ioannidis et al., 2014). This  finding indicates that the persistence of  research means a lot to the translation intensity of drugs, while the  amount of research and its changes over time do not.   This  paper  has  several  implications.  Methodologically,  this  study  showcases  how  to  investigate  the  interdisciplinarity  in  drug  research  from  the  perspective  of  translational  science,  which  provides  a  novel  bibliometric perspective for the research community and could be applied to other domains. Meanwhile, there  are significant difference detected between breakthroughs (the first-in-class drugs) and the follow-on drugs by  the  5  indicators  proposed  in  this  paper,  including  the  4  bibliometric  indicators  for  characterizing  interdisciplinarity  of  drug  research  and  the  translation  intensity  of  drugs.  This  demonstrates  that  these  5  indicators could be valuable for pharmaceutical companies, policymakers and researchers to predict the success  of drugs. In addition, the indicators proposed in this paper could be adopted and duplicated to other objects, such  as medical devices, vaccines and human genes.   There are several limitations of this study. First, our analysis considers only seven kinds of research in drug  research from the translation perspective, which ignores the research at other levels, such as research involving  the industry, the academia, the funding agencies and the government departments. The landscape of research  among these different agencies could have influenced the translation of drugs. Second, the data used in our  analysis is limited to the PubMed articles. Some other data source on drug research and development, such as  patents, clinical trials, government files and web pages, in which interdisciplinary information were recorded,  should be included. In our future work, we will integrate different categories of data sources for investigating  multiple attributes of drug research and take into consideration other types of research at other levels (e.g., author,  institution  and  biomedical entities). In  addition, these  findings in  this paper mainly  based  on  the  18  FDA  approved drugs; although these drugs belong to six different drug categories used for different diseases, we don’t  know whether they can be generalized to all drugs. In future work, we will aim to test the proposed measures on  other drugs to see whether generalized patterns exist in different translation processes. we also plan to use data  driven methods and regression analysis on a large-scale drug-related dataset to understand the role of different  kinds of research and their interdisciplinary characteristics in translating basic drug discoveries to therapies for  human diseases.
