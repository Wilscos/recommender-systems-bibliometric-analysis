We propose a powerful adaptive contrast test with ordinal constraint contrast coeﬃcients determined by observed responses. The adaptive contrast test can perform using easily calculated contrast coeﬃcients and existing statistical software. We provide the sample SAS program codes of analysis and calculation of power for the adaptive contrast test. After the adaptive contrast test shows the statistically signiﬁcant dose-response, we consider to select the best dose-response model from multiple dose-response models. Based on the best model, we identify a recommended dose. We demonstrate the adaptive contrast test for sample data. In addition, we show the calculation of coeﬃcient, test statistic, and recommended dose for the actual study. We perform the simulation study with eleven scenarios to evaluate the performance of the adaptive contrast test. We conﬁrmed the statistically signiﬁcant dose-response for the sample data and the actual study. In the simulation study, we conﬁrmed that the adaptive contrast test has higher power in most scenarios compared to the conventional method. In addition, we conﬁrmed that the type 1 error rate of the adaptive contrast test was maintained at a signiﬁcance level when there was no diﬀerence between the treatment groups. We conclude that the adaptive contrast test can be applied unproblematically to the dose-response study. A primary objective of a dose-response trial is to verify a statistically signiﬁcant doseresponse relationship. After conﬁrming the dose-response, a recommended dose is selected based on eﬃcacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, eﬃciency of a manufacturing, and so on. In general, various analyses are proposed to conﬁrm the dose-response relationship. For example, there are to identify a recommended dose according to the dose-response from the viewpoint of safety [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The analyses method are also proposed to identify a recommended dose from the perspective of safety and eﬃcacy [7, 8, 9]. In this paper, we consider an analysis method to verify the statistically signiﬁcant dose-response to verify a proof-of-concept (PoC) in terms of eﬃcacy. Various analyses to conﬁrm dose-response have been proposed [10, 11, 12]. In particular, multiple comparison procedures with modeling techniques (MCP-Mod) have been used in various clinical trials [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. In an MCP part of the MCP-Mod, contrast coeﬃcients are given based on multiple dose-response models, and statistically signiﬁcant dose-responses are conﬁrmed from contrast tests adjusted for multiplicity. After the dose-response is conﬁrmed, in a Mod part, a dose-response model is selected by using Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Tmax. A recommended dose is selected based on the clinical meaningful diﬀerence from the control group. However, we feel a hassle to calculate the contrast coeﬃcient based on the dose-response model and the multivariate t-distribution to adjust for multiplicity. In particular, we can not analyzed the existing statistical analysis software (SAS) procedure. SAS is basically used in a new drug applications. In the R software, there is a MCPMod procedure. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for example, requires that the MCP-Mod package follow the guidelines of the General Principles of Software Validation. We consider it not easy to conﬁrm to the FDA that the MCPMod package is in compliance with the guidelines and that there is no problem using the MCP-Mod package. In this paper, we propose the simple adaptive contrast test with ordinal constraint contrast coeﬃcients determined by observed response. The adaptive contrast test can perform using easily calculated contrast coeﬃcients and existing statistical software. We provide the sample SAS program codes of analysis and calculation of power for the adaptive contrast test. After the adaptive contrast test shows the statistically signiﬁcant doseresponse, we consider to select the best dose-response model from multiple dose-response models. Based on the best model, we identify a recommended dose. We demonstrate the adaptive contrast test for sample data given by Bretz et al.[10]. In addition, we show the calculation of coeﬃcient, test statistic, and recommended dose for the actual study by Akizawa et al. [22]. We perform the simulation study to evaluate the performance of the adaptive contrast test compared to MCP-Mod. This paper is organized as follows. Chapter 2 introduces the adaptive contrast test and model selection. In addition, the analyses of sample data and actual study are demonstrated. We have shown the conﬁguration of simulation. Chapter 3 describes the results of simulation. Chapter 4 is discussion. Chapter 5 shows a sample program codes for power calculation and analysis in SAS. We consider the randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, dose-ﬁnding study. The number of arms including the placebo group is k. The number of patients treated is n observed responses are Y = (Y by an analysis of covariance or mixed-eﬀects model for repeated measures. We assume that a larger Y indicates a trend toward improvement. However, even if the improvement trend is reversed, an analysis can conduct without any problem. In Section 2.3, we show an example of improvement as Y is lower. The standard deviations are S The statistical hypothesis testing for verifying proof of concept (PoC) is conducted by a contrast test. The test statistic is T = followed by the statistic, a statistically signiﬁcant dose-response is shown, and the PoC for an investigational drug is accepted. We propose a novel adaptive contrast test. First of all, we give an ordinal constraint of each element of the contrast coeﬃcients c. For example, we assume that c increases quasi-monotonically in a dose-dependent, the ordinal constraint of c is c c≤ ··· ≤ c constraint, the each of c is calculated based on the observed responses Y . c by(k − 1)Y 2, 3, . . . , k. The reason for taking the maximum value is to satisfy the ordinal constraint c≤ cat a dose j that is larger than dose i. We show examples of observed response Y and contrast coeﬃcient c for four arms in Figure 1. The constraint of c is c The chas no constraint because we are interested in the c adapting ﬂexibly to an umbrella shape. For the case 1 to case 5, the c shows a similar trend in the observed response. For the case 6, the observed response of dose 3 is lower than that of dose 2. Hence, the contrast coeﬃcient of dose 2 is the same with the coeﬃcient of dose 3. The formulas for each c in the example are c calculation of c using actual response values, in the case 1, for Y = (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8), each of c is c c= 0.6 − 0.4 + (−0.1) = 0.1, and c Y = (0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.6), each of c is c 0.4 − 0.2 + (−0.2) = 0, c (i = 1, 2, . . . , k). The subscript ”1” of nrefers to the placebo group. The (n− 1) S. When T exceeds the upper 2.5% point of the distribution . The constraint should be deﬁned before the start of study. Under the −max(Y)and c= max(Y(Y) + c, i = ) − max(Y) + c, c= Y− max(Y) + c. As an example of the speciﬁc =(3 × 0.2 − 0.4 − 0.6 − 0.8) = −0.3, c= 0.4 − 0.2 + (−0.3) = −0.1, statistic T is calculated using the calculated c. Because the test statistic using c with ordinal constraints does not follow the t-distribution, we use the permutation method to calculate the p-value. The permutation method is design-based analysis method which is suitable for randomized design in dose-response studies. In other words, the randomized design is not a random sampling design. If all response values are the same or all the investigational drug groups are lower than the placebo group, the test statistic is set to zero. When a statistically signiﬁcant dose-response is veriﬁed, we are interested in identifying the recommended dose from a dose-response model ﬁtting the observed response. We consider to use the AIC to select a dose-response model. Candidate models include Linear, Log-Linear, Emax, Exponential, Quadratic, and Logistic models. If the best model is selected, the recommended dose should be selected using minimal eﬀective dose (MED). The MED is a clinically meaningful diﬀerence from placebo. If there is a clinically meaningful change in response from baseline in the medical guideline, the recommended dose can select from the doses that are changed meaningful rather than looking at the diﬀerence from placebo. We demonstrate the adaptive contrast test by using the sample dataset given by Bretz et al.[10]. The sample dataset consists of data from 20 patients per group in the placebo and four drug groups (dosages: 0.05, 0.20, 0.60, and 1) in a randomized trial. The responses of each group follow a normal distribution. The sample means are Y = (0.345, 0.457, 0.810, 0.934, 0.949) S= 0.740, S 0.810−0.934−0.949) = −0.354, c 0.111, c= 0.934 − 0.810 + c statistic is T = 3.330, the one-sided p-value of the permutation method is p = 0.0003. We can have conﬁrmed the statistically signiﬁcant dose-response. We consider the model selection. We choose the best model from Emax, Linear log, Linear, Exponential, Quadratic, and Logistic models in terms of prediction for each dose response by using the AIC. Because the AIC of Emax model is the smallest, Emax is selected as the dose-response model. We have summarized the transition for each model in Figure 2. We re-analyze the phase 2b study of evocalcet for hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism using the summary data. The objective of the study is to conﬁrm the PoC of eﬃcacy for the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, dose-ﬁnding design. The patients were assigned randomly to a placebo, 0.5, 1, 2 mg/day of evocalcet group for 3 weeks treatment period. The primary endpoint = 0.765, and S= 0.947. The elements of c are c=(4 ×0.345 −0.457 − is the percent change from baseline in intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) at the end of treatment. The primary analysis is contrast test with seven contrast patterns for a doseresponse. The PoC was shown by a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in the percent change in iPTH. The secondary analysis calculated the sample mean and standard deviation of percent change from baseline in the intact PTH of each group at end of treatment. The results (Mean±SD) of percent change from baseline in the intact PTH were 5.44±25.85% in placebo, -8.40±25.43% in 0.5 mg, -10.56±22.86% in 1 mg, and -20.16±34.23% in 2 mg. Because a lower value for the percent change indicates an clinical improvement, a constraint on the contrast coeﬃcient is given as c cients c based on the formula replacing the maximum function with a minimum function, c= 13.86, c cess to the individual data for this study, we show the upper points for t-distribution. The upper 2.5% point of the t-distribution is 1.98, The upper 0.25% point of the t-distribution is 2.86. The upper 0.05% point of the t-distribution is 3.38. We have conﬁrmed that the result is statistically signiﬁcant even when the signiﬁcance level is suﬃciently small. We conﬁrmed the power based on the sample mean and standard deviation in this study, and the power was 92.04%. Based on these results, we assume that the permutation method shows statistically signiﬁcant. Although this study shows the 90.0% power via multiple contrasts test, the power for the adaptive contrast test following the setting of sample size in this study was 91.7%. We consider the model selection. E value 5.44 at placebo. E The estimator estimatorˆθ is −24.21. The AIC is 21.3. Linear model is E -14.12. The AIC is 25.9. Exponential model is E The estimators model is E Logistic model is E 0.36. The AIC is 25.8. The minimum AIC is shown for the Linear log-dose model, we select the Linear log-dose model as the best dose-response model. We show the all models in Figure 3. We show examples of recommended dose selection. If a 10% decrease in the rate of change in iPTH has clinical implications, we can select the dose 1.0 or more. If a diﬀerence of 10% or more from placebo is a clinical meaningful, we can select the dose 0.5 or more. = 0.02, c= −2.14, and c= −7.56. Pooled variance is S= 773.17. ˆθ is 0.40. The AIC is 22.4. Linear log-dose model is E+ θ log(d + 1). The ˆθandˆθare 1.48 and −6.87, respectively. The AIC is 35.1. Quadratic + θd + θd. The estimatorˆθis -24.19 andˆθis 5.79. The AIC is 22.9. We evaluate the statistical power of adaptive contrast test compared to the MCP-Mod via simulation study. We assume the randomized dose-response study with ﬁve arms and onesided signiﬁcance level 2.5%. The dosages are d = (d The number of simulations was set to 10,000. The constraint of contrast coeﬃcient is also consider the umbrella shape. The number of permutations for permutation method is 50,000. The MCP part of MCP-Mod evaluates the models shown in the Table 1 referred by [10]. The true mean value of each dose is shown in Table 2. The scenario 1 refers to the constant mean values to conﬁrm the signiﬁcance level maintaining at 2.5%. For the scenario 2 to the scenario 7, the true mean values are generated by the dose-response models in the Table 1. For the scenario 8 to the scenario 11, we assume the results with the dose-response relationship that is not based on a dose-response model. The standard deviation is 1.5. ≤ c. The coeﬃcient cfor the highest dose has no constraint because we The results of the simulation study are shown in Table 4 and Figure 4. The scenario 1 conﬁrmed that the signiﬁcance level of 2.5% was maintained for all adaptive contrast test and MCP-Mod. The power increased with increasing sample size for the adaptive contrast test and MCP-Mod except in Scenarios 1 and 5. For the adaptive contrast test (N=100), the power was higher than the MCP-Mod in scenarios 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11, while MCP had higher power in scenarios 2, 5, and 7. MCP had lower power in scenarios 9, 10, and 11, which were not generated from the model, compared to scenarios 2 to 7, which were generated from the model. Supplementally, we show the results of quasi-monotonically increasing for the ordinal constraint of all contrast coeﬃcients (not apply Umbrella shape) in Supplementary Analysis 6. We proposed the adaptive contrast test and model selection. The contrast coeﬃcients are given the ordinal constraint before the study starts and adaptively determined in a datadependent. We have conﬁrmed that the adaptive contrast test has higher power because of the contrast coeﬃcients determined adaptively. On the practical side, the contrast coeﬃcients are easy to calculate. The statistical test is performed by permutation method, which can be easily computed using, for example, the multtest procedure in SAS, permute in STATA, or perm package in R. In addition, we provide the sample SAS program codes of analysis and calculation of power for the adaptive contrast test in Chapter 5. We proposed a procedure to choose a dose-response model from candidate models and select a recommended dose after a statistically signiﬁcant dose-response has been conﬁrmed. We also provide the sample program codes using the existing SAS procedure for model selection in Chapter 5. We demonstrated the adaptive contrast test for the sample study given by Bretz et al.[10]. We have conﬁrmed the statistically signiﬁcant dose-response. In addition, we selected the dose-response model via the AIC. In addition, We re-analyzed the actual phase 2b study by Akizawa et al.[22]. We showed the determined contrast coeﬃcients and the contrast test statistic. The test statistic implied that the results were statistically signiﬁcant, and we selected the best dose-response model. We presented recommended doses with clinically meaningful eﬃcacy based on the dose-response models. The power of the adaptive contrast test showed higher than the permutation test for multiple contrasts used in the actual phase 2b study. We performed the simulation study to evaluate the power of adaptive contrast test compared to the MCP-Mod. In many scenarios, the adaptive contrast test has higher power than the MCP-Mod. We consider that the power was high by identifying the optimal contrast coeﬃcients in a data-dependent. We conﬁrmed that the one-sided type 1 error rate of the adaptive contrast test was maintained at 2.5% when there was no diﬀerence between the treatment groups. Hence, there was no problem with the performance. The power of MCP-Mod was relatively high when the true mean of each group was based on the dose-response model. However, the power of MCP-Mod decreased when the true mean was generated not-dose-response model. In reality, because the true mean values do not transition based on the dose-response model the MCP-Mod may not be able to maintain the expected power. For the ordinal constraint of the contrast coeﬃcient, when the quasi-monotonic increase assumption was made for all coeﬃcients without assuming an umbrella type, the power increased for the all scenarios except for the scenario generated from an umbrella type. We recommend the assumption of quasi-monotonic increase for all coeﬃcients when no umbrella type is assumed in the eﬃcacy data. The adaptive contrast test is a powerful test that can perform using easily calculated contrast coeﬃcients and existing statistical software. We conﬁrmed that the adaptive contrast test is the higher power than not only the permutation test with multiple contrast patterns but also the MCP-Mod. When we plan to use the permutation test with multiple contrast patterns and MCP-Mod, we need to explain the procedure of those methods, assumption of dose-response models and adjustment of multiplicity to clinicians and decision-makers. We proposed the analysis method that can avoid the multiplicity and be easy-to-understand of analysis procedure. The adaptive contrast test can be easy to execute by the simple analysis program. We provide the sample SAS codes, SAS is basically used in new drug applications. Therefore, we hope that the adaptive contrast test will be used in many dose-response studies. proc import out=dat d a t a f i l e =”\biom . x l s x ” /∗ Add path . biom . x ls x c onv ert ed from data ( biom ) o f R MCPMoD package ∗/ run ;
