<title>arXiv:2110.15468v1  [stat.ME]  29 Oct 2021</title> be able to collect data on one of the paired organs from an individual[1], resulting in the so-called combined unilateral and correlated bilateral data [2]. For example, in the double-blind randomized clinical trial conducted to compare two antibiotic treatments for the treatment of acute otitis media with eﬀusion [3], 214 children were randomly assigned to receive either amoxicillin or cefaclor after undergoing unilateral or bilateral tympanocentesis. The study compared children with eﬀusion-free ears and those ”improved” from their original status (children with bilateral middle ear eﬀusions at entry but only unilateral middle ear eﬀusions after the treatment) in both treatment groups. Thus, some patients contribute data on two ears while others contribute data on one ear. In such situations, correlations between two ears of the same individual need to be considered. Ignoring the correlation will falsely estimate the variability, resulting in invalid p-values and conﬁdence intervals [1][4][5][6]. Many standard statistical tests that assume independent observations cannot be applied in this situation. Various methodological research on analyzing binary correlated data has been done that considers the within-cluster correlation, commonly used methods are the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), and the marginal model using generalized estimating equation (GEE) approaches [5][7]. GLMM incorporates ﬁxed eﬀects and random eﬀects and can be applied to non-normal data such as data from Binomial distributions and Poisson distributions by using appropriate link functions [8][9]. To take the intraclass correlation into account, for example, the correlation between ears in the above example, covariance structures of random eﬀects need to be speciﬁed. GEE approach was originally proposed to analyze the longitudinal data [10], it has then been extended to analyze various types of clustered data [11]. It is a marginal model-based approach that is very useful when the joint distribution is not available. A working correlation matrix is selected to address the correlation, and a sandwich estimator is used to adjust the variance of the estimator in ﬁtting the marginal model. Methods based on maximum likelihood estimates and tests have also been developed to address the correlation for binary correlated data which can provide an iterative form or an explicit form of the test statistics, for example, homogeneity tests proposed by Ma et al. [12], Ma and Liu [13], and Ma and Wang [2], common tests and interval estimations on the relative risk, the diﬀerence by Zhuang et al. [14], Zhuang et al. [15], Shen and Ma [16], Xue and Ma [17], and Peng et al. [18]. Epidemiology and clinical research is largely based on the measurement of the relative eﬀect [19]. When the parameter of interest is the relative risk of an exposure, commonly used methods for independent binary data are the modiﬁed Poisson regression model [20][19] and the log-binomial model [21][20][22], which have been discussed in many papers [23][24][25][26][27]. The log-binomial model uses the log link function for the binomial regression, while the modiﬁed Poisson regression applies the Poisson regression to binomial data and uses a robust error variance procedure known as the sandwich estimation to account for the model mis-speciﬁcation. Both methods use log link functions and thus give a straightforward estimate of the relative risk. The relative risk can then be estimated as the exponential of the coeﬃcient of the indicator. Logistic regression is not a good choice in such situations since the required computations are tedious if we adjust the relative risk from the logistic regression [28][29]. In addition, na¨ıve conversion of an adjusted odds ratio from the logistic regression to a relative risk has issues such as invalid conﬁdence limits and inconsistent estimates for relative risks[19][30]. The issue of using the log-binomial model is the non-convergence problem [19][26][23]. The modiﬁed Poisson regression overcomes the non-convergence problem in the log-binomial regression, and is as ﬂexible and powerful as the binomial regression[23][19], it has become a popular alternative to the log binomial model [24][25][27]. When the binary data is clustered, the modiﬁed Poisson regression in the GEE framework with the robust sandwich variance estimator can be used to account for clustering eﬀects and model mis-speciﬁcation [24]. In situations where the correlation structure diﬀers among groups, although the modiﬁed Poisson regression model with binary correlated data can give consistent estimates, the model may be less eﬃcient [10] due to incorrectly speciﬁed working correlation matrix since only one correlation structure can be set for the whole model with the GEE framework. In addition, we may need to consider diﬀerent working correlation structures to achieve convergence in the real analysis [23]. An alternative of the modiﬁed Poisson regression with the robust sandwich variance is a mixed-eﬀect model with random cluster eﬀects, but the distribution of the random eﬀects may be diﬃcult to verify, and the model mis-speciﬁcation may have a large impact on the results [23]. In addition to the model-based methods for estimating relative risks, several test-based methods have been proposed. For example, Peng et al. [18] proposed several asymptotic conﬁdence intervals (CI) for relative risks for correlated binary data, Xue and Ma [17], and Zhuang et al. [15] further developed CI methods of relative risks for stratiﬁed correlated binary data under diﬀerent assumptions for the intraclass correlation. When the sample size is small, Wang and Shan [31] derived twelve exact intervals for the relative risk and the odds ratio for data collected from a matched-pairs design or a two-arm independent binomial experiment. However, none of these methods can be applied to the combined unilateral and correlated bilateral data. In this paper, we propose three interval estimation methods for combined unilateral and bilateral correlated data. Hypothesis tests of the three proposed methods are also given. We use Rosner’s model to take care of the intraclass correlation that assumes equal dependence across groups and allows different intraclass correlations in diﬀerent groups. The three parametric methods are based on maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) solved from the real root of the fourth-order polynomial and Fisher iteration methods, which are very eﬃcient and have no convergence issues. We also include the method of the variance estimates recovery (MOVER), which does not consider the intraclass correlation as a baseline method, and the modiﬁed Poisson regression for correlated binary data as a comparison of the model-based method. In Section 2, we derive the constrained and unconstrained MLEs, propose three CIs, and discuss a baseline method (MOVER) and a model-based method (the modiﬁed Poisson regression approach) as comparisons. In Section 3, simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and compare with the other two methods based on the empirical coverage probability (ECP), the mean interval width (MIW), and the ratio of mesial non-coverage probability to the distal non-coverage probability (RMNCP). Section 4 illustrates the proposed methods with a real dataset. Finally, we give some concluding remarks in Section 5. 2.1. Notation and setting. Without loss of generality, we use notations in the example mentioned above for simplicity. However, the proposed methods can also be applied to other studies with outcomes obtained on paired organs. Suppose there are two groups of combined unilateral and bilateral correlated data (see Table 1). For those who contribute bilateral data to the analysis, let m denote the number of patients who have t (t = 0, 1, 2) ears with a response (e.g., the presence or absence of some disease or condition) in the ith (i = 1, 2) group, m + m = S denote the total number of patients with t ears, and = m denote the total number of patients in the ith group. For patients who contribute unilateral data to the analysis, let n denote the number of patients who have k (k = 0, 1) ears with a response in the ith group, n + n = N denote the total number of patients with k ears, and = n denote the total number of patients in the ith group. Therefore, the total number of patients is S + S + S = M in the bilateral group and N + N = N in the unilateral group. To analyze the binary correlated data as shown in Table 1, the correlation between two ears of the same patient needs to be taken into account. Ignoring the correlation will falsely estimate standard errors and result in invalid p-values and powers [32][6][6][33]. Here, we use the model proposed by Rosner (R model) [34], which assumes equal dependence between two ears of the same patient in the two groups, to address the intraclass correlation. Let π (i = 1, 2) be the probability of having a response in a ear in the ith group, Rosner’s model [34] assumes, where Z = 1 if the rth ear of the jth patient in the ith group has a response at the end of the study, and 0 otherwise, i = 1, 2, j = 0, . . . , m + n , r = 1, 2. R is a positive constant that measures the dependency between ears of the same patient. Note that R satisﬁes 0 < R ≤ 1/a, if a ≤ 1/2; (2 −1/a)/a ≤ R ≤ 1/a, if a > 1/2, a = max{π , i = 1, 2} [12][2]. Based on (2.1), it is easy to calculate the correlation between two ears of the same patient in the ith group, which is ρ = corr(Z , Z ) = (R −1) [2]. Therefore, for the ith group, the observed data (m , m , m ) and n follow the multinomial and binomial distribution[2], respectively: (m , m , m ) ∼ Multinomial(m , (Rπ − 2π + 1, 2π (1 − Rπ ), Rπ )), ∼ Binomial(n , π ). Table 1. Data structure in a combined unilateral and bilateral design. + n log (1 −(π δ)) + n log(π δ) + constant. 2.2. Maximum-likelihood estimates. 2.2.2. Constrained MLEs. Under H , the relative risk π /π = δ , one can solve the following equations to estimate π and R ∂l(δ , π , R) ∂l(δ , π , R) (2.4) = 0, = 0. ∂π ∂R Again, there are no closed form solutions for (2.4), we use the Fisher scoring algorithm of the form (2.5) to obtain the constrained MLEs (2.5) + I (π , R where π and R denote estimates of π and R from the tth iteration, I (π , R ) is inverse of the Fisher information matrix for (π , R ) (see Appendix A.1 for the formula of I(π , R), and ). Here, the unconstrained MLEs ˆπ , i = 1, 2, and R are set as initial values in the iteration. The iteration stops when the diﬀerence of estimates between two steps is suﬃciently small (e.g., |π − π | < 10 , |R − R | < 10 ). The constrained MLEs of π and R are denoted as ˆπ and , respectively. 2.3. Hypothesis tests and conﬁdence intervals. In this section, we propose three conﬁdence intervals, the score conﬁdence interval (SC), the proﬁle likelihood conﬁdence interval (PL), and the Wald-type conﬁdence interval (W). Test statistics of the three methods are also provided. The proposed conﬁdence intervals are based on MLEs derived in Section 2.2. In addition, we introduce two existing methods, the method of variance estimates recovery (MOVER) [35] and the modiﬁed Poisson regression model. The MOVER-based conﬁdence interval does not consider the intraclass correlation and uses the adjusted simple proportion estimates rather than MLEs. Therefore it can be seen as a baseline method. The modiﬁed Poisson regression model is a popular method for estimating relative risk for binary data. In the context of correlated binary data, Zou and Donner [36] extended the modiﬁed Poisson regression model by applying the sandwich variance estimator to account for both the cluster eﬀect and the model mis-speciﬁcation. The modiﬁed Poisson regression approach has been proven to have as reliable relative risk estimates as that obtained from the log-binomial regression [36], but does not have convergence problems that are common in the log-binomial regression. We include this model-based method as a comparison of our proposed test-based methods. where χ is the 100(1 − α)th percentile of the chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom. The lower and upper bounds of δ can be solved from the two roots of the equation T (δ ) = χ . We use the following steps to obtain the upper bound of δ: Step 1: Set unconstrained MLEs for (δ, π , R) as initial values , ˆπ Step 2: Let + flag × stepsize, set flag = 1, stepsize = 0.1. Follow the iteration algorithm for obtaining constrained MLEs in Section 2.2.2, we can have MLEs for π and R under δ = , denote them by ˆπ and Step 3: if flag × (δ, π , R)|δ = , π = ˆπ , R = < flag × χ , return to Step 2. Otherwise, set flag = −f lag, stepsize = 0.1 × stepsize and return Step 2. Step 4: Repeat Step 2 and Step 3 until stepsize < 10 . Report as the upper bound of δ = The lower bound of δ can be solved by setting flag = −1 in Step 2 and changing the condition to flag × (δ, π , R)|δ = , π = ˆπ , R = > flag × χ in Step 3. = 2[l( δ, ˆπ R) −l(δ , ˆπ )]. |T (δ ) ≤ χ where χ is the 100(1 − α)th percentile of the chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom. The conﬁdence interval limits can thus be estimated by solving the equation T (δ ) = χ . Follow similar iteration steps in Section 2.3.1, except that the inequality in Step 3 is replaced by flag × T |δ = , π = ˆπ , R = < flag × χ , we can obtain the 100(1 − α)% proﬁle likelihood conﬁdence interval for δ = and = max 0, δ − z respectively. (2.8) [exp(L ), exp(U )]. Plugging ˆπ , ˜n , L , U , i = 1, 2 into (2.7) and (2.8) gives the upper and lower bound of the MOVER-based Agresti and Coull conﬁdence interval. 2.3.5. Modiﬁed Poisson regression model-based conﬁdence interval. When the parameter of interest is the relative risk, one of the most popular approaches for the binary outcome is the modiﬁed Poisson regression model suggested by Zou [19]. It is a useful alternative to the log binomial regression and overcomes convergence problems of the log binomial regression approach occurred during the iteration procedure [19][23][24]. This method applies the Poisson distribution to the data with a robust error variance to avoid over-estimated standard errors of the relative risk. Furthermore, the modiﬁed Poisson regression approach uses a log link, thus it can estimate relative risks directly rather than the odds ratio estimated by the logistic regression model. In the context of correlated binary data, Zou and Donner [24] further adjusted the middle term of the sandwich estimator used in the modiﬁed Poisson regression model to address the correlation and account for the model mis-speciﬁcation. Using the Poisson regression, the model is given by: P r(y = 1) = π = exp(β + β ), where A = ˆπ , B = (y − ˆπ )][ (y − ˆπ )x ], which is computed by ﬁrst grouping the score contributions according to patients. In our case where there is only a single binary exposure, the variance estimate for can be simpliﬁed as: where z is the 100(1 − α/2)th percentile of the standard normal distribution. Since the modiﬁed Poisson regression approach is under the GEE framework, we call (2.9) the GEE-based CI (GE). To investigate the performance of CIs discussed in Section 2, simulation studies are performed to compare the empirical coverage probability (ECP), the mean interval width (MIW), and the ratio of mesial non-coverage probability to the distal non-coverage probability (RMNCP). We set the null H : δ = δ the formulas for ECP and MIW of a given CI can be expressed as I[δ ∈ (δ , δ )] ECP = and (δ − δ MIW = respectively, where N denotes the number of replications, δ and δ denote the upper and lower bound for the ith replication, respectively. We use RMNCP to measure the bias of a given CI. It is deﬁned as the left non-coverage probability as a proportion of the total non-coverage probability. The formula is given by I[δ < δ ]/N RMNCP = I[δ < δ ]/N + I[δ > δ ]/N I[δ < δ I[δ /∈ (δ , δ )] 3.1. Simulation designs. First, we consider some properly selected parameter settings. Speciﬁcally, we set sample size m = n 30, 50, 100 (in the tables and ﬁgures for the simulation results, the notation is m = n = 30, 50, 100), i = 1, 2, dependency measurement R = 1, 2, 3, relative risk under the null δ = 1, 1.5, 2, and the baseline rate π = 0.2, 0.3 (π = π ). For each parameter setting, 10000 data sets are simulated under the null hypothesis, we then estimate the three proposed CIs, the Mover-based CI, and the CI based on the modiﬁed Poisson regression model (GEE-based CI) under 10000 replications. ECPs, MIWs, and RMNCPs can thus be evaluated based on the formulas shown above. We present results in Table 2-4. We know that the correlation between two ears for the ith group ρ is determined by ρ = corr(Z , Z ) = (R − 1), i = 1, 2. Therefore, larger dependency measurement R gives larger between ear correlation . For the same parameter settings, we set R from 1 to 3 by 0.1 to cover a wide range of ρ to evaluate the performance of ECP and MIW of the methods as the change of between ear correlations. Results are shown in Figure 1-4. In addition to scenarios with speciﬁc parameter settings, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the ﬁve CIs, we compare their ECPs, MIWs, and RMNCPs based on randomly generated parameters. 1000 random parameter settings are generated for π , R and δ from uniform distributions. For each Table 2. ECP based on 10000 simulations under diﬀerent parameter settings. randomly generated parameter setting, 10000 replications are performed under sample size m = n 30, 50, 100, i = 1, 2. The simulation results for ECPs, MIWs, RMNCPs are summarized in the boxplots (Figure 5-7). All the CIs are based on the 5% signiﬁcance level. Table 4. RMNCP based on 10000 simulations under diﬀerent parameter settings. and π = 0.3, respectively. Each row in these two ﬁgures indicates diﬀerent relative risks under the null, while each column indicates diﬀerent sample size scenarios. The score CI performs the best since its ECP is the closest to the nominal coverage in all cases. The GEE-based CI also performs satisfactorily Figure 1. ECP on diﬀerent dependency measurements R with π = 0.2. but is slightly conservative compared to the score CI, especially when the sample size is not large (e.g., m = n = 30). Both the Wald-type CI and the proﬁle likelihood CI have some results well below the nominal coverage probability, while the Wald-type CI is always more liberal than the proﬁle likelihood CI. We also ﬁnd that the Wald-type CI is closer to the nominal coverage generally under m = n = 30, 50 for π = 0.3 compared to when π = 0.2. In addition, when δ 6= 1, the ECP of the Wald-type CI has a decreasing trend when R increases (i.e., the correlation between ears increases). The MOVER-based CI is extremely liberal as expected since the intraclass correlation is not considered and its performance declines quickly as the increase of R. As the sample size goes large, all of the CIs get closer to the nominal coverage except for the MOVER-based CI since all of the methods are asymptotic methods except for the Mover-based CI. Table 3 shows the simulation results for MIW of the ﬁve CIs. All the CIs are close to each other except for the GEE-based CI, which gives larger MIWs than the other CIs, especially when R becomes large. From Figure 3-4, we note a monotonically increasing relationship between the GEE-based CI and R. Therefore, although the ECP of the GEE-based CI is close to the nominal coverage probability under all scenarios, this CI is not recommended due to its larger MIW. The proposed three methods give Figure 2. ECP on diﬀerent dependency measurements R with π = 0.3. similar MIW while the MIW for the score CI is always between the MIW of the Wald-type CI and the proﬁle likelihood CI. The boxplots (Figure 5-7) summarize scenarios of randomly generated parameter settings. Even under a larger sample size (m = n = 50, 100), the ECP (Figure 5) for the score CI and the GEE-based CI are closer to the nominal level than the proﬁle likelihood CI and the Wald CI. Furthermore, as the sample size goes large, MIWs (Figure 6) become smaller for all CIs. Boxplots also conﬁrm that the score CI has the best performance because it produces the closest nominal coverage probability with reasonable MIW and RMNCP on the whole parameter space. Therefore, we recommend the score CI in applications. In this section, we use an example to illustrate the interval estimation methods discussed in Section 2. A double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted at two sites to compare two antibiotics for the treatment of acute otitis media with eﬀusion (OME) [3]. A total of 214 children aged 2 months 16 years were randomized to receive either amoxicillin or cefaclor after undergoing unilateral or bilateral tympanocentesis. The primary outcome is the eﬀusion-free status at follow-up, measured at the patient Figure 3. MIW on diﬀerent dependency measurements R with π = 0.2. level. Table 5 shows the presence or absence of OME at 42 days, which consists of 173 children out of the sample of 214 children with 93 children in the Cefaclor group and 80 children in the Amoxicillin group. We are interested in the relative risk and the conﬁdence interval of the cured ears in the two treatment groups. In the original study [3], the conclusion was given by comparing the percentage of children without eﬀusion or ”improved” (means those with bilateral middle ear eﬀusions at baseline but only unilateral after the treatment) in the two treatment groups (68.9% vs. 67.5%), indicating a relative risk of 0.9797 without considering intraclass correlations. Here, we apply the three proposed methods and the two existing methods to this example to illustrate our methods and compare them to the results in the original study [3]. The tests and interval estimators developed in this article are based on Rosner’s equal dependence model. Thus, goodness of ﬁt tests need to be performed to check if the R model is appropriate for this dataset before using the proposed methods. Several goodness-of-ﬁt tests have been proposed by Liu and Ma [39] to examine the intraclass correlation problem arising in bilateral data. Based on the goodnessof-ﬁt tests they developed, both the likelihood ratio test (G ) and the Pearson chi-square test (χ ) show Figure 4. MIW on diﬀerent dependency measurements R with π = 0.3. that the Rosner’s model ﬁts for the data well, which give us G = 0.3871 with p-value= 0.5338 and = 0.3867 with p-value= 0.5341. Therefore, we can apply our methods to this example. Based on the maximum likelihood estimate algorithm derived in Section 2.2, we obtain the unconstrained MLEs for the probability of children with eﬀusion-free ears and ”improved” ears in the Cefaclor group π , the proportion ratio of children with eﬀusion-free ears and ”improved” ears after treatments in the two groups δ, and the dependency measurement R, which give us ˆπ = 0.6528, δ = 0.9841, R = 1.3172, respectively, intraclass correlations in the two groups are ˆρ = 0.5964 and ˆρ = 0.5699. The relative risk estimate based on the maximum likelihood derived in this paper is 0.9841, which is close to the relative risk estimate in the original paper (0.9797). We also obtain estimates of the relative risk and the conﬁdence interval using the proposed three methods and the two methods mentioned in Section 2.3.4 and Section 2.3.5. The results are shown in Table 6. We see that the MOVER-based CI and the GEE-based CI have smaller relative risk estimates than the proposed three methods. The interval width for the three proposed methods ranges from 0.3123 to 0.3260. The interval width for the GEE-based CI is the largest, which is 0.4217, corresponding to the ﬁndings in the simulation studies in Section 3.2 that the GEE-based CI always gives a larger interval width. We can also see that all the CIs include 1, indicating Figure 5. Boxplots for ECP under diﬀerent sample sizes. The horizontal dashed and dotted line corresponds to the nominal coverage probability. that we fail to reject the null hypothesis H : δ = π /π = 1. It suggests that the probability of ears being cured under the two treatment methods is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. This result corresponds to the result in the original paper that by 42 days after entry, the proportion of children with eﬀusion-free ears and ”improved” ears in the two treatment groups were not diﬀerent. In this article, we developed three conﬁdence intervals for the relative risk: the score CI, the Wald-type CI, and the proﬁle likelihood CI based on MLEs derived using the Fisher scoring method. The Wald-type CI can be easily derived while the score CI and the proﬁle likelihood CI are computed by our eﬃcient searching algorithm. We used Rosner’s model, which assumes equal dependence between two ears of the same patient across groups, to address the between ear correlation. The three proposed methods were compared with two existing methods, the MOVER-based method and the modiﬁed Poisson regression model. Simulation results indicate that the score CI works the best because its empirical coverage probability is the closest to the nominal coverage probability with reasonable mean interval width and RMNCP. The Figure 6. Boxplots for MIW under diﬀerent sample sizes. proﬁle likelihood CI and the Wald-type CI are liberal in the simulations, especially when the sample size is relatively small. The MOVER-based CI is extremely liberal because the intraclass correlation is not taken into account. The GEE-based CI is slightly conservative when the sample size is small. For a large sample size, its performance of ECP is very comparable to that of the score CI. However, the GEE-based Figure 7. Boxplots for RMNCP under diﬀerent sample sizes. CI tends to have larger interval widths compared with other methods under large R. Interestingly, there is an increasing trend for the mean interval width of the GEE CI when R becomes large, while the trend for the mean interval width of the three proposed methods is decreasing, which indicates that our methods have a more reliable interval width in a wide range of the intraclass correlation. Therefore, the score CI is recommended for general analysis in that its performance is the best in all settings evaluated. Model-based methods are more ﬂexible because they can incorporate covariates and allow ﬂexible choices of the cluster size. However, they cannot specify the group-speciﬁed correlation structure that addresses diﬀerent intraclass correlations in diﬀerent groups as the dataset discussed in this article, and thus may suﬀer from model mis-speciﬁcation. In addition, model-based methods cannot provide an explicit form or the iterative form of the test statistics, and the convergence may not be achieved [25][36][26]. The three proposed methods and the model-based method are asymptotic methods. Therefore they may not perform well when the sample size is small. With the explicit form of the test statistics as provided in this article, we are able to derive the exact method for small sample size scenarios in the future. Since the proposed methods assume Rosner’s model, we should perform goodness of ﬁt tests to evaluate if the data ﬁts the R model before using our methods. Care should also be taken when the true rate is very large or small (close to 0 or 1) or when the intraclass correlation is very large. [1] Ian E Murdoch, Saul Sutkover Morris, and Simon N Cousens.
