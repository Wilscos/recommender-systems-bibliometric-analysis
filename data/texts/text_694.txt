<title>Citation network applications in a scientiﬁc co-authorship recommender system</title> <title>1 Introduction</title> <title>arXiv:2111.15466v1  [cs.DL]  22 Nov 2021</title> network. Embeddings produced by these methods can be eﬀectively applied to the diﬀerent forecasting tasks including prediction of network connections as well [8]. Graph neural networks allow us not only to boost performance in straightforward link prediction task on co-authorship network, but to improve the quality on such a forecasting challenge via aggregation of additional information from the citation graph. Future development of the discussed pipeline can lead to the simpliﬁcation of the collaboration assessment process for the R&D team management. <title>2 Related work</title> Recommender systems for scientiﬁc communities have a long history of development. Early approaches in this area [1, 13] were based on deterministic network information, which lacked the ability to represent complex features of graph data. Learning algorithms in the area of link prediction resolved a variety of issues related to capture of graph intricacies. The explicit examples of such models are local random walk [8] and local naive Bayes [9]. Various metrics such as content similarity LDAcosin [3] were also applied in this ﬁeld. Another popular method [11] leverages linear regression on feature vectors of nodes and set of graph measures [10]. However, implementation of a learning feature extractor instead of deterministic metrics would signiﬁcantly boost the performance of such pipelines. Applying this idea to the collaboration network structures, usage of graph neural networks becomes native [17]. Despite the promising results achieved by graph neural networks, diﬀerent techniques could be implemented to further increase their eﬃciency. Those methods include the alteration of graph topology [14] and the usage of taskindependent techniques like Node2Vec in order to create initial node representations which serve as better inputs for GNNs [5]. <title>3 Data</title> We use classic HEP-TH dataset [7] as the subject for further development and extension. It consists of citation and co-authorship graphs obtained from the arXiv papers published between January 1993 and April 2003 in the area of high energy physics theory. Unfortunately, there is no connection between these two parts of the dataset (authors’ IDs were not provided in the citation network) which makes its initial second part worthless for our purposes. To our best knowledge, the potential of the HEP-TH citation network was never explicitly revealed. Due to the presence of highly useful paper metadata (such as author lists or abstracts), the range of the dataset usage can be signiﬁcantly extended. In order to complete our current research, we perform processing of the citation graph metadata aiming to restore the corresponding co-authorship network. To preserve homogeneous nature of the reconstructing graph, we discarded from the citation graph all anonymous papers. Along with the information about authors and abstracts, HEP-TH involves a journal reference ﬁeld with the publisher output information. The presence of such data provides us an opportunity to extract ISSNs of indexed publications and further parse scientiﬁc metrics (quartile, h-index, and impact factor) from the ”SCImago Journal & Country Rank” website. <title>4 Methods</title> where 𝑙+1 is the current number of a convolutional layer, ℎ = 𝑥 , 𝑊 is the matrix of learning parameters, and ℎ can be extracted by diﬀerent aggregation functions like Max Pooling or Mean aggregator. Node2Vec. This algorithm generates sequences of nodes via second-order random walks and utilizes them as the input data for a skip-gram model. The skip-gram generates pairs from input and context nodes in order to cast them to the feedforward neural network. Its weights can be used as the desired node embeddings as a result of the following function optimization: where 𝑛(𝑣 , 𝑣 ) is the number of times that 𝑣 occurs in 𝑣 context within twindow size in the generated set of random walks, 𝑊 is the weight matrix from the input layer to hidden layer and 𝑊 is the weight matrix from the hidden layer to the output layer. Link prediction step follows after the publications embeddings generating. For this task, we consider the co-authorship graph 𝐺( 𝑉 , 𝐴, 𝑋), where 𝑉 = {ˆ𝑣 , ˆ𝑣 , . . . , ˆ𝑣 } is the set of graph vertexes (authors), 𝐴 : 𝑚 × 𝑚 → {0, 1} is the adjacency matrix (each edge encodes collaboration between the two authors), and 𝑋 : 𝑚×𝑘 → R denotes the matrix of node features (one-hot encoded research interests of authors). In order to supply the predictive model by additional data about publications of the authors, we extend each element ˆ𝑥 of the matrix 𝑋 to ˆ𝑥 as follows: where 𝑁 is the output size, 𝑦 is the true link labels, ˆ𝑦 is the predicted link existence probabilities. <title>5 Results</title> We performed training and evaluation on the PC with 1 GPU Tesla V100 and 96 GB of RAM. The weights of the neural networks were updated by Adam optimizer. We divided graph edges into train, validation and test samples in ratio 3:1:2. We evaluated the set of models with various link embedding operators, representation learning models, and aggregation functions. As the main quality measurements, we chose binary accuracy, AUC-ROC, and F1-score. Received embeddings from the models were tested on the supervised GraphSAGE setup applied to the link prediction task. We conducted experiments with more than 80 diﬀerent conﬁgurations and represented key results in Table 1. The ﬁrst two baselines were selected as the best among the approaches using either vectors of authors interests without citation network information or just embeddings of the abstracts. Comparison of these simpler architectures with full models which includes two graph neural networks could be interpreted as an ablation study. As it is shown in the table, the proposed aggregation algorithm positively inﬂuences the quality of scientiﬁc collaboration forecasting. The model without any citation data signiﬁcantly suﬀers from the lack of expressive input features as well as the pipeline including only the abstracts of the papers. Obtained result allow us to report that proposed aggregation strategy eﬃciently utilizes citation graph properties. <title>6 Conclusion and Outlook</title> In the present paper, we brieﬂy introduced the two-stage pipeline for the collaboration prediction task. Performed computational experiments reveal the perspective of citation data utilization in sense of co-authorship network extension. The embeddings generated by GNNs eﬀectively capture the network properties including its topology and vectorized abstracts represented as features of the corresponding graph nodes. Our main contributions in the present work are the following: 1. We perform extraction of the co-authorship graph from the corresponding HEP-TH citation network. 2. Presence of useful metadata allows us to parse the scientiﬁc signiﬁcance measures of the publications (e.g., impact factor). 3. We aggregate structural data from the citation graph and apply it to the coauthorship network in order to evaluate its inﬂuence on the link prediction quality. Along with the future improvements of link prediction methods in the area of scientiﬁc collaboration, we intend to explore qualitative and quantitative assessment approaches of emerged links. As the probabilistic estimation of collaborations is not suﬃcient, it is important to extend it by less abstract metrics. In the following, we are going to leverage the average impact factor and the total number of publications for this task. <title>Acknowledgements</title> We acknowledge fruitful discussions with Natalia Semenova. <title>References</title>
