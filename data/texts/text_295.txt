“Plus on vieillit, et plus on se persuade que Sa sacr´ee Majest´e le Hasard fait les trois quarts de la besogne de ce mis´erable univers.” The present paper oﬀers a reform for the draw procedure of sports tournaments with various restrictions on the allocation of the teams into groups. Examples include qualiﬁcations for the recent UEFA European Championships, the European Qualiﬁers to the FIFA World Cup, and the UEFA Nations League. The outcome of the classical scheme of extracting teams from pots is presented to depend on the order of the pots. According to our simulations, the draw of the European Qualiﬁers to the 2022 FIFA World Cup could have been closer to uniform distribution with a careful choice of the pot labels and additional randomisation. The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is strongly encouraged to consider the suggestion in order to build fairer tournaments in the future. authors have developed draw systems for sports tournaments with geographical or seeding restrictions to produce balanced groups having roughly the same competitive level (Cea et al., 2020; Guyon, 2015; Laliena and L´opez, 2019). The draw procedure of the 1990 (Jones, 1990), 2006 (Rathgeber and Rathgeber, Some recent sports tournaments establish restrictions in the draw of the group stage. In this case, the mechanism used by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) to assign the teams into groups is unevenly distributed since not all valid allocations are equally likely. It is shown by illustrative examples how a careful choice of the pot labels and randomisation in the size of the groups can reduce that unfairness. According to our Monte Carlo simulations, the draw of the European Qualiﬁers to the 2022 FIFA World Cup could have been closer to uniform distribution without any negative eﬀects. Our recommendation has a good chance to be implemented in practice.

Focusing on the FIFA World Cup, several 2007), and 2014 FIFA World Cups (Guyon, 2015) have been proved to be unevenly distributed. The bias of the matching mechanism used in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 draw has also been quantiﬁed (Boczo´n and Wilson, 2018; Kl¨oßner and Becker, 2013). Guyon (2014, Section 3) demonstrates that the UEFA rules do not guarantee a uniformly distributed outcome for the group draw. the UEFA nor recognise the role of pot labelling, which constitute our central contributions. In addition, their proposals for approaching uniform distribution require either the relaxation of draw constraints or a fundamental restructuring of the draw procedure. Consequently, our recommendation that does not aﬀect the main principles of the draw has better prospects to be implemented in practice. qualiﬁers to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The uneven distribution of the UEFA mechanism is discussed in Section 3, and the superiority of our modiﬁed versions is veriﬁed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes. The European section of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualiﬁcation is contested by the 55 national teams of the UEFA for 13 available slots. It traditionally consists of a group stage followed by a play-oﬀ phase. In the ﬁrst round, the teams are drawn into ﬁve groups of ﬁve teams (Groups A–E) and ﬁve groups of six teams (Groups F–J) each. The groups are played in a home-away round-robin format. The group winners qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the runners-up progress to the second round of the qualiﬁcation. group rankings, the procedure should create groups having roughly the same competitive level. As usual, balancedness is achieved by seeding: the 55 teams are classiﬁed into six pots based on the FIFA World Rankings of November 2020 such that Pot whereas Pot 6 consists of the ﬁve lowest-ranked teams. to the next pot. The ﬁve teams from Pot 6 are assigned to the last ﬁve groups (Groups F–J). Therefore, every group contains at most one team from each pot. teams, fulﬁls the expectations of our commercial partners and ensures with a high degree of probability that the ﬁxture can take place as scheduled” (UEFA, 2020a): The constraints substantially complicate the draw procedure because some allocations become infeasible. The standard UEFA mechanism assigns the team drawn to the ﬁrst available group in alphabetical order as indicated by the computer such that at least one allocation remains feasible for the teams still to be drawn, thus any dead end is avoided. Following the previous literature on constrained assignment in sports tournaments, a draw is called fair if all feasible allocations of the teams into groups are equally likely. Otherwise, the distortions caused exclusively by the draw procedure favour certain teams and harm others. to understand some causes of the bias through basic examples. However, the above works neither discuss the more complicated draw constraints recently used by The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the group draw of the European The group draw decides the composition of the qualifying groups. Since the qualiﬁcation depends on The draw starts with Pot 1 and continues with Pot 2 until Pot 6. Each pot is emptied before proceeding However, UEFA applies various draw conditions “to issue a schedule that is fair for the participating •Competition-related reasons: The four participants in the UEFA Nations League Finals 2021 should play in a group with ﬁve teams (Groups A–E). •Prohibited team clashes: The UEFA Executive Committee decided that four pairs of teams cannot be drawn into the same group. •Winter venue restrictions: At most two out of the ten countries identiﬁed as venues with risk of severe winter conditions can be placed in a group. The Faroe Islands and Iceland, having the highest risk, cannot play in the same group. •Excessive travel restrictions: A maximum of one country pair out of the 18 identiﬁed with excessive travel relations can be drawn into the same group. As demonstrated in Guyon (2014, Section 3), the UEFA mechanism is unfair. It is not a futile exercise Example 1.

While this is not a problem in the case of prohibited clashes, it is disadvantageous for more complex restrictions such as the winter venue constraint. Example 2. sequentially such that at most two teams from the set group. Table 1 compares the probability that two teams play in the same group under three procedures: Teams 𝑇 1 and 𝑇 2, 𝑇 4 and 𝑇 5, as well as 𝑇 8 and 𝑇 9 are treated equally by the three methods. among which eight are infeasible (when there are only four cases in which teams group should be aﬀecting the teams of Pot 3, thus its standard version places probability of 1 the two teams to the same group only with a probability of 1 already contains 𝑇 6 and either 𝑇 8 or 𝑇 9. While both of the latter procedures are biased concerning the pair mechanism is closer to uniform distribution than the standard UEFA mechanism for all pairs of teams. 𝑇4 (the only team in the last pot) should be assigned to group C. In an evenly distributed random 𝑇2 should play in group A and group C with an equal chance of 50%, respectively. However, the The problem of Example 1 can be solved by additional randomisation. If the group of team𝑇4 ×1/3 + 1/3×1/2 + 1/3×1/6 = 1/3 under the UEFA mechanism. This coincides with the chance of Another drawback of the oﬃcial rule is the inﬂexible treatment of the draw constraints for the sake of • Uniform distribution; • Standard UEFA mechanism with the draw order Pot 1, Pot 2, Pot 3; • Modiﬁed UEFA mechanism where the draw order is Pot 3, Pot 2, Pot 1. Since the labelling of the groups is arbitrary, there are 6!×6! = 36 diﬀerent allocations of the teams, 𝑇3 and𝑇6, the error is much smaller for the modiﬁed variant. What is more, the modiﬁed UEFA and 2 but for two teams in Pot 3, it is better to start the draw with Pot 3 to minimise the chance that the allocation of the teams will be seriously restricted later. Example 2 uncovers the non-negligible role of pot labelling. Regarding the extent of the departure from even distribution, previous papers were able to derive exact results both in the case of the FIFA World Cup draw (Jones, 1990; Rathgeber and Rathgeber, 2007; Guyon, 2015) and the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 draw (Kl¨oßner and Becker, 2013). In our case, it is clearly impossible because there exist which they can be drawn. Although the draw conditions somewhat reduce this number, for instance, it is suﬃcient to investigate only 4! × 6! cases for Pot 1 instead of 10! due to competition-related constraints, the degree of unfairness can be quantiﬁed only via simulations. Therefore, they will be compared on the basis of 10 million randomly generated draw orders. ﬁrst available group in alphabetical order. Hence the outcome might be closer to uniform distribution if the groups that consist of six teams are labelled randomly, see Example 1. Table 2 shows the number of draw constraints by pots. Based on Example 2, the draw is worth starting with pots containing more national teams aﬀected by the winter venue constraint. Consequently, three options will be considered: which a country pair is placed in the same group under the draw procedure considered and an evenly distributed random draw among all feasible allocations. In the comparison of method distribution, the bias for teams 𝑖 and 𝑗 is if the value of the fraction is above one and the reciprocal of the fraction minus one otherwise. Hence, the bias equals one if teams compared to a fair draw. the pots massively reduces positive deviations, the cases when a country pair has a higher probability to be assigned to the same group in the draw by the UEFA rule. Even though the worst negative deviation cannot be avoided, the average of the most extreme values can be decreased in this case, too. According to both aggregated measures of distortions, the modiﬁed UEFA draw procedure would be substantially fairer. The highest biases are not treated by randomisation in the group labels, however, it improves fairness for most pairs. mechanism is better for 665 and the oﬃcial rule is more favourable for 560 country pairs. Analogously, The explanation of Example 2 is intuitive: since the draw constraint applies for one team in Pots 1 To summarise, randomisation in the group size can reduce unfairness according to Example 1, whereas The oﬃcial UEFA draw rule is not independent of the group labels as the teams are assigned to the •Oﬃcial UEFA mechanism with the standard draw order Pot 1, Pot 2, Pot 3, Pot 4, Pot 5, Pot 6; •Modiﬁed UEFA mechanism: analogous to the oﬃcial UEFA mechanism but the draw order is Pot 1, Pot 3, Pot 5, Pot 4, Pot 2, Pot 6; •Modiﬁed random UEFA mechanism: analogous to the modiﬁed UEFA mechanism but the groups with six teams are chosen randomly at the beginning of the draw. The degree of unfairness is quantiﬁed by the similarity between the number of simulation runs in # when teams 𝑖 and 𝑗 are assigned to the same group under uniform distribution Table 3 presents the performance of the three draw procedures. The proposed change in the order of These ﬁndings are reinforced by focusing only on the direction of changes. The modiﬁed UEFA the modiﬁed random UEFA procedure is less (more) distorted in 735 (490) cases than the modiﬁed UEFA method. for Pots 2, 3, and 4 (teams ranked between 11th and 40th), especially regarding three countries identiﬁed with risk of severe winter conditions, Ukraine (16), Iceland (27), and Belarus (38). The eﬀects for the other three pots are more ambiguous, however, teams drawn from Pots 5 and 6 have a marginal chance to qualify for the FIFA World Cup. Therefore, the increased unfairness of the modiﬁed UEFA mechanism for Kosovo (46) and Kazakhstan (47) is not really embarrassing. Compared to the modiﬁed UEFA method, the modiﬁed random UEFA procedure is beneﬁcial for 48 (47) nations according to absolute (squared) Rank of the national team in the ranking used for the drawRank of the national team in the ranking used for the draw Figure 1 plots the bias of the draw procedures separately for each national team. Our proposal is fairer distortions. diﬃcult to interpret because the outcome of the draw procedures, including the evenly distributed one, is not deterministic. To get more insight into this issue, the whole comparison has been repeated with another uniformly distributed draw—but the results have remained the same. We have proposed reasonable changes in the draw procedure of sports tournaments where the groups contain a diﬀerent number of teams and there exist various draw restrictions. It has been highlighted through an illustrative example that relabelling of the pots can substantially reduce the gap of the mechanism used by the UEFA to the uniform distribution. An initial random choice of larger groups is also worth considering. Our recommendation is not the philosopher’s stone, it is not able to eliminate all distortions. However, it avoids the most severe biases t almost no price. Changing the order of the pots can even contribute to the excitement of the draw: as Pot 2 contains the strongest teams outside Pot 1, the fans of the best teams cannot ease until the event is almost ﬁnished. for the 2020 UEFA European Championship, competition-related draw conditions were addressed without randomisation, namely, the four Nations League ﬁnalists were drawn into Groups A–D (UEFA, 2018) rather than into four randomly chosen groups from the ﬁrst ﬁve as in the draw of the European Qualiﬁers to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Similarly, the pots were ordered in a reversed order of strength for the 2020/21 UEFA Nations League draw, that is, the lowest-ranked teams were drawn ﬁrst (UEFA, 2020b). Our proposals require only one more step in that directions and they are exactly in line with the UEFA policy of ensuring the fairness of the draw (UEFA, 2019).
