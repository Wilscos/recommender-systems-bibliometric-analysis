Space biology research aims to understand fundamental effects of spaceflight on organisms, develop foundational knowledge to support deep space exploration, and ultimately bioengineer spacecraft and habitats to stabilize the ecosystem of plants, crops, microbes, animals, and humans for sustained multi-planetary life. To advance these aims, the field leverages experiments, platforms, data, and model organisms from both spaceborne and ground-analog studies. As research is extended beyond low Earth orbit, experiments and platforms must be maximally autonomous, light, agile, and intelligent to expedite knowledge discovery. Here we present a summary of recommendations from a workshop organized by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and modeling applications which offer key solutions toward these space biology challenges. In the next decade, the synthesis of artificial intelligence into the field of space biology will deepen the biological understanding of spaceflight effects, facilitate predictive modeling and analytics, support maximally autonomous and reproducible experiments, and efficiently manage spaceborne data and metadata, all with the goal to enable life to thrive in deep space. At the molecular and cellular levels, space biology experiments seek to characterize all possible spaceflight-induced changes in cell morphology , development and differentiation , protein regulation epigenetic processes , and gene expression , among others . Organ-level modeling systems like tissue-on-a-chip models are used to study shifts in cellular organization and communication . The current understanding of biological responses to spaceflight incorporates experimental evidence from a variety of data types along hierarchical biological levels, from molecular to single-cell to whole-organism (Figure 1). At the cellular level, six fundamental responses to spaceflight have been well characterized, including increased oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysregulation, and telomere length, as well as epigenetic and microbiome changes . These responses have been linked to a variety of physiological effects, including cardiovascular dysregulation, central nervous system impairments, bone loss and immune dysfunction The majority of current space biology knowledge originated through ground-analog experiments from satellites in LEO , and from experiments on the Space Shuttle or on the International Space Station (ISS) . Despite decades of such experiments, essential biological knowledge gaps remain for humanity to travel safely to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. LEO space experiments have most often been conducted by astronauts, which is inefficient and often necessitates small sample sizes. The design of more efficient and autonomous experimental research beyond LEO must not overburden the crew with tasks that could otherwise be automated, such as processing raw data. Furthermore, experiment hardware must be designed to be as low in mass and volume as possible, and to autonomously produce science results without guidance from crew or from Earth. In this review, we present findings from the ‘Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Modeling for Space Biology’ organized by NASA in 2021, which sought to map out the roles of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and biological-computational modeling in the field of space biology over the next decade. A separate article in this issue reviews workshop recommendations regarding these roles for astronaut health (Scott et al., 2021 [unpublished preprint]; Supplements 1 and 2). Overall, the workshop concluded that fundamentally transformative approaches leveraging cutting edge data, coding, and AI-ML methods are needed for space biology, in addition to a general streamlining of biological experimentation and research activities in space to maximize validation of results (for both LEO experiments and beyond). These approaches must facilitate the generation and analysis of reproducible datasets which incorporate multiple types of measurements to achieve a comprehensive characterization of organismal responses to a variety of extraterrestrial conditions. Such datasets can then be used for robust predictive modeling of spaceflight responses at every biological level (Figure 1). We propose a widespread implementation of AI and ML methods at every level of space biology research (from ground to spaceborne research). This effort has the potential to revolutionize the breadth and depth of our knowledge base in two central ways: (1) enabling efficient, intelligent, and maximally autonomous experimental design and data collection in space research environments, where maximally implies as autonomous as possible while including an essential human link to assess, evaluate, and act on results and (2) by assisting management, analysis, modeling, and interpretation of current and future space biology datasets. However, it is difficult to leverage these technologies to their full potential in space, where workforce and resources are extremely limited. Most experimentation in space is expensive, time-consuming, and not automated, necessarily resulting in small experiments with few samples and replicates and significant variability due to differing sample handling procedures . This makes ML analysis of space biological data difficult, as the models become under-determined and overfitted to the training data due to high dimensionality (tens of thousands of variables compared to tens or hundreds of data points), and technical batch effects make it challenging to combine datasets to gain higher sample numbers. To mitigate processing batch effects, NASA GeneLab provides open-source, uniformly processed multi-omics data from spaceflight and ground-analog studies, making space biology multi-omics data as AI-ready as possible and providing a roadmap for the management of other spaceflight-relevant data (phenotypic, physiological, imaging, microscopy, and behavioral) . Additional work is needed to establish widely-adopted standards for AI-readiness in these research domains . These standards can then be leveraged by automated, on-board, end-to-end data collection and analysis platforms which we discuss in the following sections. A comprehensive effort to streamline and automate biological experimentation in space is needed to generate the large-scale, high-quality, AI-ready, reproducible datasets required to meaningfully expand and validate our scientific understanding and knowledge base. On Earth, basic molecular biology tasks such as pipetting, sequencing library preparation, cell culture maintenance, microscopy, quantitative phenotyping and behavioral change detection have already been automated in a variety of platforms . Biofoundries apply high-throughput laboratory automation to generate thousands of strain constructs and DNA assemblies per week . These advances now enable robust technical reproducibility across experiments, allowing researchers to isolate only the effects of relevant biological independent variables. However, these platforms still require significant personnel operation and hands-on time. Ideally, a fully automated experimental system for spaceborne research will integrate multiple robotic functions (e.g., pipetting + cell culture + microscopy photo capture and analysis + phenotyping + cell lysis and nucleic acid isolation + library preparation + sequencing + data analysis). The only human input required should be the initial setup of experimental parameters and the command to begin experimentation, and system-requested input when unexpected experimental outcomes are observed. Recent years have seen successful sequencing of nucleic acids aboard the ISS, facilitated by a long-read sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) . Predictably, significant testing and adjustment was required for the sample loading and sequencing procedure due to the effects of microgravity on liquid dynamics , illustrating the investment required to automate complete experimental procedures in space, but providing a powerful example for transitioning state-of-the-art research capabilities to space. The ultimate goal of developing and employing automated, AI-supported bioexperimentation systems such as self-driving laboratories should be to inform autonomous Precision Space Health systems that provide decision support for crew health management during LEO, cis-Lunar, and Mars missions (Scott et al 2021 [unpublished preprint]). As automated experimentation becomes more widely available, the space biology field should shift to conducting longitudinal studies , characterizing physiological changes over the duration of an entire mission. These longitudinal data will help identify biomarkers from various physiological, molecular and microbial systems that can be integrated to create individualized baseline models for humans and other organisms. Monitoring in-flight changes to these biomarker signals will help predict and prevent adverse organismal health outcomes, and predict how different organisms will react to spaceflight conditions. Raw biological data can be complex, sparse, and heterogeneous, and is therefore not typically ready for AI applications. Biological measurements relevant to a single scientific question may be discrete or continuous, qualitative or quantitative, single- or multi-dimensional, incomplete, highly descriptive (e.g. the appearance of cells in culture), and unstructured (particularly for phenotypic and behavioral data). Different experimental practices between facilities and researchers manifest as biases in the data, complicating integration of data from various experiments into a unified platform. For space biology, the NASA GeneLab open-source data repository has attempted to transform available 'omics data into AI-ready formats. However, significant manual work remains to process other types of data into AI-ready formats . In order to best leverage all available data, the space biology field needs to invest in tools to perform automated conversion from existing, non-AI-ready formats into AI-ready formats. To facilitate this, the community needs a set of standardized ontologies and data formatting guidelines for space biology (for example, the inclusion of a datasheet to describe each dataset ). These standards can then inform experimental design to ensure that data from future missions are generated in an AI-ready format. A key part of these data standards is the establishment of uniformly used vocabularies that are grounded in common conceptualizations (i.e. ontologies), which increase data discovery and reuse. Biomedical ontologies have existed for over 50 years and many are in widespread use , but no single ontology includes foundational concepts in the space biology domain (e.g., specially-developed experimentation hardware types, space environment types and parameters, etc). The space biology community should focus efforts on developing one or more such ontologies to standardize metadata with respect to space-relevant concepts and data structures (similar to the recent open-source, "Radiation Biology Ontology'' publication by NASA GeneLab and STOREDB ). Automated, AI-assisted data harmonization and dataset curation will be a critical part of advanced Space Biology research architectures like the one shown in Figure 3. Such architectures must be designed to support the entire experimental process: from investigation management, to experiment execution, to data publication, through Open Science data repository submission, with appropriate security and governance measures to guarantee protection of private data resources. Investigators will be supported by an embedded digital experiment notebook to preserve experimental parameters and analyses, with link-out capability to approved, external data resources for seamless integration with research data. Use of space biology metadata ontologies can support automated harmonization across the wide spectrum of organisms studied, equipment used, and experimental designs. Because space biology datasets cover a range of modalities, each requiring distinct data processing, such advanced architectures must include a suite of metadata and data acquisition, and data processing tools. The proposed environment is similar to the successful virtual observatory paradigm in the planetary sciences, and effective methodology transfer from planetary science to biomedical research has already occurred between NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the National Cancer Institute's Early Detection Research Network   Full utilization of such an environment would ensure that all newly generated datasets are AI-ready, and facilitate conversion of previously generated datasets into AI-ready formats. Additionally, embedded Open Science capabilities will enable broad data sharing and reuse, and avoid metadata decay and long-term data maintenance issues. A similar data management tool was implemented recently by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to address data harmonization and standards for their principal investigator and research community . Ultimately, such an architecture will be cloud-based and linked to in-flight data acquisition systems, and eventually deep space communication for critical data downlinks. Finally, it will be important to establish and adopt robust dataset readiness metrics in order to aid AI-modeling researchers in understanding the applicability of various datasets. Technology Readiness Levels have already been proposed for ML methods ; such metrics, if applied to datasets, could be useful for understanding the AI-readiness of space biological data. Moreover, a Bronze/Silver/Gold reproducibility standard has been proposed for life science ML workflows . A similar standard could be implemented for ML analysis of space biological data in order to ensure reproducibility and confidence in results. These standards would be tailored for different ML methods. Space biology combines the complexity of the biological and medical fields with an entirely new dimension: extended spaceflight in environments not known on, or very different from, Earth. Therefore, it is important that we consider the development of AI/ML algorithms specifically designed for data collected in novel space constraints and environments. Inferring the effects of space environments on human physiology from model organisms is nontrivial. Transfer learning, an ML method in which knowledge from models trained in one system is applied to a different system, has been used to map insights from mouse to human . The space biology field should increase its application of transfer learning to leverage the huge amounts of spaceflown and radiation-exposed animal model data for insights into mammalian-human physiological responses to spaceflight. Further, transfer learning can be implemented in settings beyond LEO where models pretrained on larger, Earthbound datasets can be used to find insights in space biology research data generated during spaceflight. We recommend the creation of a collection of generative models (model zoo) that have been pre-trained for each of the main types of space biology data; similar to the Kipoi repository for pre-trained models in genomics . These models, which typically use generative adversarial (GANs) or variational autoencoder architectures (VAEs) , can be used to produce synthetic data to validate the performance and translatability of new and existing space biology AI/ML modeling methods. These models should be engineered to support translation training for specific validation needs. For example, the EGRESS model generates symptomatic ECG signals that resemble the output of an astronaut wearable device, providing a large dataset of realistic synthetic data upon which to train models for astronaut health monitoring and GANs have been used to generate synthetic DNA and RNA sequencing data. Our discussion so far has focused on both classical and contemporary AI methodologies. The next generation of AI models, neuromorphic computing, will closely mimic human neural structure and cognition in order to understand and predict outcomes in novel situations without context Neuromorphic processors are extremely small and light, making them ideal for space transport. This technology can be developed for deep space knowledge discovery, maximally autonomous platforms, and mission support. Space biological data is often collected in environments with limited analogous or comparable settings on Earth. The lack of context makes classical inference difficult, but incorporation of neuromorphic computing tools will allow us to learn novel insights from these datasets. Further, these next-generation models can be used to study and predict the function of extraterrestrial organisms (e.g., in studying extremophile physiology). Beyond human neural computation, we should invest in development of biologically-informed deep learning algorithms . In terrestrial biomedicine, such algorithms have been developed for biomedical capabilities such as patient stratification and drug response prediction . Space biology could benefit from development of similar algorithms inspired by the biomorphic computing of known or newly discovered organisms in extreme environments. For example, immortal jellyfish are known to continuously regenerate their neural networks in anoxic or very low oxygen environments in the deep ocean . Inspiration can be found in extreme biological neural compute methods to develop novel AI methods which may be more appropriate for learning about extreme environments like those found in space. The ultimate goal of space biological research is to be able to predict the effects of spaceflight at all physiological levels within diverse living systems, then develop the building blocks to support life, and bioengineer the foundations for sustained life beyond Earth. Such predictive modeling and bioengineering will only be possible once we are able to model all parts of living systems, introduce perturbations, and measure genetic, cellular and physiological outcomes longitudinally. Building on automated, robotic and longitudinal data capture capabilities, space biology research will benefit from the development of predictive models of whole organisms (“digital twins”), which integrate multi-scale mechanistic mathematical modeling of an entire complex organism; from genes to cells to tissues to organs . There now exist whole-cell computational models of microbes Mycoplasma genitalium and Escherichia coli for cellular predictions, and the ongoing Physiome Project develops mathematical models of the human body, from cells to tissues to organs, integrating chemical, metabolic, cellular and anatomical information . Such models could integrate microbial-host cell interactions and environmental coupling data to predict responses to microbial population change or environmental perturbations. It will be important to identify an appropriate set of reference organisms (bacteria, eukaryote, archaea, viruses) as targets for high-fidelity digital twin models, which could be used to predict biological response under diverse extraterrestrial environments. Digital twins will be critical for advancing several goals relevant to human space exploration. They will be useful for predicting the effects of spaceflight hazards on human physiology and for designing interventions or predicting the outcomes of countermeasures. They will enable the development of predictive models that can be personalized to individual human astronauts based on unique differences in genetics or physiology. Moreover, they can serve as useful scaffolds for extrapolation across organisms of different species through transfer learning. Understanding the physiological effects of spaceflight stressors on human health will drive a need for biomedical interventions that can normalize or optimize astronaut physiology, including engineered cells or tissues (e.g., radiation-resistant skin, engineered retinas optimized for space-induced changes in air pressure, enhanced bone and muscle density, cells with increased DNA repair pathways, etc.). AI will be required for the scalable design of engineered cells and tissues. Currently cell and tissue engineering activities are predicated on a design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle, which requires tremendous human input and time. AI is beginning to transform these bioengineering activities by automating and scaling DBTL cycles . For example, ART (Automated Recommendation Tool) is an AI-powered algorithm that leverages probabilistic modeling to recommend bioengineering interventions that can maximize production of useful metabolic engineering products. Methods like ART will soon enable the design of entire gene circuit architectures, given the growing availability of highly predictive computational models of mammalian gene circuits and demonstrations that AI can bridge the gap between DNA sequences and engineered functions . These approaches will be important for designing cells and tissues to perform functions unique to space biology. Validation of the safety and efficacy of engineered cells and tissues will be a critical step toward deployment. AI will be needed to understand and predict the cell differentiation and cell fate dynamics of engineered tissues once they are implanted in human astronauts: for example, CellNet is a network biology platform that was developed to evaluate stem cell differentiation states relevant to target cell types. This platform has now been modernized to accommodate RNA sequencing data and has been useful for assessing cell and tissue engineering methodologies . Similarly, CellOracle leverages mammalian gene regulatory networks to predict gene expression dynamics following genetic manipulations, and Enformer leverages deep convolutional neural networks to predict gene expression from DNA sequences. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing has driven several AI-powered algorithms for analyzing cellular dynamics and inferring cell fate trajectories . New “logical switches” on customized T-cells can create entirely new kinds of immunotherapies, and these tools could eventually be used to target specific aberrant receptors in damaged cells . Methods such as these will be important for benchmarking and evaluating engineered cells and tissues. Our current understanding of the multi-tiered physiological effects of spaceflight stressors on a mammalian organism is derived from a tiny amount of human astronaut data and hundreds of small, expensive, model organism biological experiments performed manually during a variety of spaceflight missions. Workshop participants agreed that to advance space biology research as a field, a paradigm shift is necessary from the current manual, single-experiment paradigm, into a new era of biological research conducted in space facilitated by robotic automation, AI-driven experimental design and analysis. Workshop participants envisioned an AI/ML space biology research lifecycle, with a data management environment and appropriate AI/ML methods facilitating the acceleration of research findings and ultimately powering widespread flight data acquisition and precision health support for astronaut health (Figure 4). While much of the automation discussed above is already in use terrestrially, it is important to note that these hardware and software are not immediately suitable for spaceflight research, and steps must be taken to convert and develop these automated systems for use in-flight, likely following a logical progression of deployment(sub-orbital, ISS/LEO, Lunar Gateway, Lunar surface, and Mars transit, Martian surface, etc.). These spaceflight-ready automated systems will enable cost-effective collection of large biological data in difficult or constrained conditions. Moreover, workshop participants agreed that the next step is to couple automation with AI-assisted or AI-driven hypothesis generation and experimental design to facilitate the automatic generation of biological insights over time without the need for human input and expertise (self-driving labs). By benefiting from the high reproducibility of machines, we envision a future where automatic data and metadata acquisition will be complete and unambiguous such that AI methods will be able to accumulate such information, constantly learning from them and making the whole greater than the sum of the parts. The future of space biology experimentation envisioned during this workshop will only be possible through widespread adoption and implementation of standards for generating and maintaining data and metadata from automated and AI-driven systems. It will be vitally important to develop a set of guidelines for generating AI-ready, machine-readable data from every space biology experiment, to facilitate open access AI/ML-assisted data analysis and reuse. This must include concerted efforts to develop and maintain space biology vocabularies and ontologies that can be leveraged for automated reasoning, as well as top-down motivation to adopt standardized data management facilities. Workshop participants discussed existing AI/ML methods, models and algorithms, and agreed that the next decade of investment must include a focus on adaptation and implementation of existing methods with a specific focus on space biology. Approaches such as transfer learning and generative modeling hold great promise for space biology research, but care must be taken to adapt these methods with the constraints of spaceflight in mind. Further, novel AI/ML approaches with high potential for space biology were discussed, including neuromorphic computing. Due to limited bandwidth in space, our efforts should focus on developing multi-faceted solutions including pre-training lightweight models on larger Earthbound datasets, federated training, edge computing, and on-board processing. In the next decade, investment in AI/ML research design and analysis promises to revolutionize the way biological research is performed in space. Integration of automated and self-training systems will enable the hands-off and reproducible generation of huge cutting-edge imaging and multi-omics datasets, ready to be mined by next-generation AI/ML space biology tools. Workshop participants agreed that the key to this future involves the creation of multi-disciplinary teams with statisticians, biologists, modeling experts and hardware developers. Such partnerships will facilitate the experimentation and data analysis necessary to fully understand and begin to predict and mitigate the stressors of spaceflight, and enable life to thrive in deep space. Workshop participants agreed on several key development areas required for AI/ML technologies to be maximally integrated into space biological research: Full adoption of AI/ML methods in space biological research is an endeavor that will span the next decade, but will ultimately revolutionize the way we perform experiments and analyze data for knowledge gain. The developments discussed in this paper will finally enable us to gather the necessary data and tools to build a comprehensive characterization of the biological responses of living systems to myriad diverse space environments. This knowledge base will be essential to facilitate NASA's goals of Lunar, Martian and deep space missions, as we will be able to predict and mitigate adverse effects at all biological levels.

The workshop was organized by the NASA Space Biology Program within the Biological and Physical Science Division, part of the NASA Science Mission Directorate.  The NASA Human Research Program also supported and participated.  The workshop gathered a cohort of external-to-NASA AI-modeling subject matter experts (SME) in the fields of digital health, computer science, bioinformatics, medicine, microbiology, biomedical imaging and computational biology. On the second day of the workshop, the SME cohort and space-related researchers outlined AI and modeling recommendations and concepts for the next decade in space biology and space health.
