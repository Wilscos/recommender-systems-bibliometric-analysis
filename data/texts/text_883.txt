Keywords Venus · radiative transfer · atmospheres · molecular absorption · parameterization · unknown UV absorber General circulation models (GCMs) require high accuracy solutions of radiative transfer equation at every grid step (spatial and temporal) in order to reproduce and unknown UV absorber are parameterized with peculiar mesoscale structures that are notably presented in complex Venus’ atmosphere. By this time it is not realistic to include detailed line-by-line calculations to GCMs, and subsequently some ways of parameterization should be involved. By this time there is a sufﬁcient lack of self-consistent parameterizations that whether are not too simplistic (e.g. double-gray radiative transfer or Newtonian approximation) or not too much constrained to various atmospheric parameters, speciﬁc GCM or way of solving radiative transfer equation. So, our motivation was to offer the fresh way to accelerate radiative calculations suitable to climate modeling. The highlighted approach is based on look-up-tables of heating and cooling rates generated by Haus et al. (2017) and utilized in IPSL GCM by (Garate-Lopez & Lebonnois, 2018). However, we adhere to different concept of speeding up the radiation block of GCM. Our approach is to follow original k-distribution technique described in (Fomin & de Paula Correa, 2005) instead of familiar correlated-k method. We construct seven effective cross-sections for absorption by gaseous constituents and unknown UV absorber regardless to its chemical composition. Above mentioned parameterizations depend only on absorption cross sections data sets gained from experimental studies. Also, for more efﬁcient incorporation of this technique we suggest spectral points for calculation of Rayleigh scattering and cloud optical features. Thus, it is a universal tool to accelerate radiative transfer calculations: one needs to solve RT equation just seven times using our cross-sections to accurately reproduce ﬂuxes and heating rates in UV region, while other blocks in atmospheric modeling scheme can be unchanged. We conﬁrm the effectiveness of our parameterizations through validation with the result of the reference Monte-Carlo model, in which the atmospheric parameters relevant to ultraviolet region were inserted in accordance with the state-of-the-art model by (Haus et al., 2015). Construction of parameterizations of molecular and absorption in other spectral regions will be the subject of future works. This paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 we explain the modeling part of the work: the technique for constructing the parameterizations and description of reference Monte-Carlo model. Section 3 presents the tables with parameterizations and the result of validation by comparison fast radiative calculations with the outcome of reference model. The way we construct the parameterizations essentially corresponds to the one used in (Fomin & de Paula Correa, 2005; Fomin & Kolokutin, 2017) for shortwave region for Earth’ atmosphere with some revision. For the given spectral region ∆λ we deﬁne effective cross section σ Lambert law for every layer over the downward ﬂuxes: F Here the Fand F i-th layer that are calculated from line-by-line procedures (in order to take into account solar spectrum ﬁne structure) on the ∆λ spectral region in non-scattering atmosphere. ζ is is the absorber amount along the direct solar radiation from TOA to the given point per cm cross sections will better reproduce upward and downward ﬂuxes after inserting them in one-time simulation of radiative transfer equation. Occasionally, spectral regions where effective cross sections yield good accuracy in ﬂuxes and heating rates appear unexpectedly large. After all, subsequent validation of our parameterizations provides stable justiﬁcation of our approach. After thorough manual inspection of the whole 125 - 400 nm region, we divided it into seven k-intervals to calculate effective cross sections for each of them. In each k-interval we selected wavelength points for calculation of Rayleigh scattering in order to obtain best ﬁts with reference simulations. For convenience, optical features of the Venus’ cloud could be taken at the same point since they don’t signiﬁcantly depend on wavelength in UV region. We also specify the incident solar ﬂux at the top of the atmosphere for each k-interval as this value relates to the way of choosing solar spectrum data. All detailed information about the k-intervals is summarized in Table 1. Spectral rek-interval are the downward ﬂuxes at the bottom and the top of the Our reference Monte-Carlo model was previously successfully exploited for Earth’ conditions in UV region by Sukhodolov et al. (2016). It is a high-resolution (0.25 cm) plane-parallel short-wave version of FLBLM model (Forster et al., 2011; Fomin & Falaleeva, 2012). For the present studies it was adopted to the Venus’ conditions according to the baseline work (Haus et al., 2015), in which authors preformed line-by-line calculations along with sensitivity analysis to various spectroscopic and atmospheric parameters from 125 nm to 1000 µm. Hereafter we list the key parameters of the atmospheric model. Photoabsorption spectra of gaseous components in the atmosphere are relatively smooth in comparison with visible and IR-spectra. This fact is largely determined by the nature of absorption of UV rays: it drives the course of the chemical reaction of photodissociation. Thus, to incorporate UV spectroscopy into simulations, there is no need to trace the contours of individual lines. Relevant sources on absorption cross sections of atmospheric gaseous constituents are summarized in Table 2. Note that in some experiments extinction coefﬁcients or absorption coefﬁcients were measured, which are not so convenient in our studies. We referred to MPI-Mainz spectral atlas (Keller-Rudek et al., 2013) to gain datasets to the unique format: absorption cross-section in cm in nm. Figure 1 shows absorption cross sections as functions from wavelength for all gaseous constituents which are considered to be active in UV-region. The strongest absorption for all gaseous components is manifested in the far ultraviolet in 125-200 nm, where the intensity of solar radiation is insigniﬁcant. In present paper cross sections of carbon dioxide are represented as a combination of data from (Shemansky, 1972), Parkinson et al. (2003), Yoshino et al. (1996) in different spectral intervals. Initially following Haus et al. (2015), we missed to include recently discovered ozone (Montmessin et al., 2011; Marcq et al., 2019) in our atmospheric model. We expect, however, that due to very small abundances of about 10-20 ppbv (Marcq et al., 2019) it could be neglected in terms of its contribution to integrated ﬂux and heating rate in the whole UV region. As Haus et al. (2015) we also neglected the temperature dependence of the cross sections for all gases. Nonetheless, Marcq et al. (2019) consider temperature dependent absorption cross sections for COand SO The unknown UV absorber (UVA) is considered to be an additional source of radiation absorption in the spectral range 320-400 nm (Pollack et al., 1980). We include the UVA to our atmospheric model according to one of the latest parameterizations by (Haus et al., 2015) (we use high-altitude mode) in contrast to Crisp (1986); Marcq et al. (2019) who effectively considered it by depressing single scattering albedo of cloud mode 1. Haus et al. (2015) extracted (“retrieved”) the absorption cross sections and concentration in such a way that the simulation results were in adequate agreement with the experimental Bond albedo data by Moroz (1981). This approach allows to treat unknown UV absorber as another gas with its own concentration proﬁle and absorption cross section without specifying a concrete molecular formula. Though nominal high-altitude proﬁle given by Haus et al. (2015) features only 10 particles per cm tion cross sections conduce effective optical depths of UV absorber comparable to corresponding ones of SO UVA is still going and the cycle of sulfur species in the upper cloud layer is not yet fully understood. Because the frontier OSSO parameterization by Frandsen et al. (2016) didn’t yield realistic radiance factors in radiation scheme in work (Marcq et al., 2019), we decided to keep “retrieved” cross-section by Haus et al. (2015) regardless of chemical composition. According to Haus et al. (2015), CO active gases in UV-region which may possibly affect the outcome of radiation simulations. COabundance is assumed to be uniform in height and equals to 0.965. The SOvolume mixing ratio is considered to be 150 ppmv below 50 km and then drops rapidly at higher altitudes. The proportion of water vapor is assumed to be 32.5 ppmv below 50 km and 3 ppmv above 70 km. OCS concentrations are signiﬁcant only below cloud and HCl volume mixing ratio is set to be 0.5 ppmv for all heights. However, during validation we show that most radiation redistribution occurs only up above the cloud layer, so the inﬂuence of H negligibly small. Strength of the Rayleigh scattering is proportional to fourth power of wavenumber. Thus, it is assumed to be a vital ingredient in radiation simulations in UV region. We take Rayleigh scattering into consideration in the way similar that Haus et al. (2015) do. They made slight correction to formula of Hansen & Travis (1974) for pure CO2 atmosphere, changing the surface pressure. We use the same value of p= 92.1 bar in agreement with VIRA model. Despite Rayleigh scattering optical depth surges while going to the depth of the atmosphere, it will be shown that in UV region taking this scattering into account is minor compared to gaseous absorption. For example in F-UV region it can be completely neglected as it manifests itself in heights where nearly all the radiation is already absorbed. Solar spectrum in the UV region may vary slightly depending on solar activity. We utilized the COSI spectrum from (Shapiro et al., 2010) and (Shapiro et al., 2011), which was recommended in (Sukhodolov et al., 2016). As shown by numerical experiments, usage of a various spectra does not signiﬁcantly affect the resulting parameterizations of gaseous absorption. It is only required to change accordingly the solar ﬂuxes in each k-interval falling on the upper boundary of the atmosphere. We used ﬁxed VIRA (Zasova et al., 2006) thermal proﬁle for equatorial region on the night side from 0 to 150 km in our modeling purposes. With this approximation we abide by (Marcq et al., 2019) due to above mentioned assumption of temperature independence of absorption cross sections. So, the present parameterization could not be affected by applying different temperature proﬁles. However the heating rates depend on pressure, we expect that they predominantly are inﬂuenced by absorption features and incident solar ﬂux. Our simulating scheme uses recent cloud model that consists of four modes of 75% HSOspherical aerosols (Pollack et al., 1993; Zasova et al., 2007; Haus et al., 2013). To ﬁnd microphysical parameters we applied Mie theory code (Fomin & Mazin, 1998). All four modes are log-normally distributied with parameters of modal radii of 0.3, 1.0, 1.4, 3.65 µm and unitless dispersions of 1.56, 1.29, 1.23, 1.28, respectively (Pollack et al., 1993; Haus et al., 2013). Refractive indices data were taken from Palmer & Williams (1975). Scattering properties do not signiﬁcantly alter with wavelength in UV region. Thus, any other cloud parameters may be easily inserted in atmospheric model, as our gaseous absorption parameterization is obtained regardless of cloud features. In this section we present the resulting parameterizations. All the underlying tables were constructed for 0° zenith angle, but also colud be easily made for any other zenith angle on demand. In all tables σ is an effective cross section (in cm per one molecule) and ζ is the absorber amount along the direct solar radiation from TOA to the given point. Tables are given for the seven k-intervals deﬁned in Table 1. 1.02e+22 1.43e-22 7.97e+21 1.49e-22 6.16e+21 1.60e-22 4.67e+21 1.79e-22 3.45e+21 2.13e-22 2.46e+21 2.61e-22 1.65e+21 3.19e-22 1.03e+21 3.78e-22 5.83e+20 4.24e-22 3.03e+20 4.56e-22 1.40e+20 4.75e-22 5.91e+19 4.84e-22 2.64e+19 4.88e-22 1.28e+19 4.90e-22 5.32e+18 4.91e-22 1.68e+18 4.91e-22 3.00e+17 4.91e-22 1.34e+16 4.91e-22 6.76e+15 4.91e-22 Validation of the presented parameterizations was performed by comparison of downward and upward solar ﬂuxes and heating rates obtained through fast (KD) and reference simulations. For veriﬁcation of sustainability of our approach we also checked the parameterizations for two solar zenith angles: 0 and 75 degrees. Fig. 2 shows the solar ﬂuxes for both zenith angles. Fig. 3 also represents heating rates for both geometries. All the results are presented for the whole spectral region (integrated over the 7 k-intervals). Featured heights lie in range below 100 km. Validation displays good ﬁts, resulting with relative discrepancies of less than 3% for ﬂuxes and less than 1% for heating rates. During this procedure we also could analyze the contribution of each absorber. Thus, we state that only CO and unknown UV absorber are relevant in terms of examination the integrated UV ﬂuxes and heating rates. We investigated temperature dependence of absorption cross section of CO in F-UV region taking data of Parkinson for 195 and 295 K (Yoshino et al., 1996; Parkinson et al., 2003) and linearly extrapolating it between those temperatures. Resulting heating rates discrepancies appeared to be less than 1%. We expect that for climate modeling purposes the temperature dependence could be ignored as the relevant atmosphere is from 50-100 km where temperature doesn’t change dramatically. However, we do not expel that future research should be conducted on this issue. In this work we present parameterizations of absorption by gaseous species and unknown UV absorber in 25000 - 80000 cm rameterizations are determined only by wavelength-dependent absorption cross sections. Thus, it easily can be inserted in any radiative transfer scheme of any GCM. The result was validated with the help of original high-resolution line-byline Monte-Carlo radiative transfer model. We expect that such parameterizations can facilitate Venus’ climate modeling studies. Future works will be dedicated to creating effective parameterizations of molecular and cloud absorption in visible and infrared spectral regions.
