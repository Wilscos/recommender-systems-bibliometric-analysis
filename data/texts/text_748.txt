<title>Benchmarking the performance of DFT functionals  for absorption and fluorescence spectra of EGFR  inhibitor AG-1478 using TD-DFT </title> KEYWORDS:  Fluorescence  spectroscopy,  Absorption  spectroscopy,  Electronic  states,  Timedependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).    Optical  spectra  (UV-vis  and  fluorescence)  are  sensitive  to  the  chemical  environment  and  conformation of fluorophores and therefore, are ideal probes for their conformation and solvent  responses. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as AG-1478 of epidermal growth factor receptor  (EGFR) when containing a quinazolinamine scaffold are fluorophores. Conformers of AG-1478  have been confirmed by both experiment and theory. It is, however, very important to benchmark  computational  methods  such  as  DFT  functionals  against  optical  spectral  measurements,  when  time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) is applied to study the fluorophores. In this  study, the performance of up to 22 DFT functionals is benchmarked with respect to the measured  optical  spectra  of  AG-1478  in  dimethyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO)  solvent.  It  is  discovered  when  combined  with  the  6-311++G(d,p)  basis  set,  B3PW91,  B3LYP,  B3P86,  BPE1BPE,  APFD,  HSEH1PBE, and N12SX DFT-V  functionals are the top performers. Becke’s three-parameter  exchange  functional  (B3)  tends  to  generate  accurate  optical  spectra  over  other  exchange  functionals.  The B3PW91  functional  is  the  recommended  DFT functional  for optical  property  calculations of  this  class of  TKIs whereas  B3LYP  is excellent  for absorption  calculations and  B3P86 is best for emission calculations. Any corrections to B3LYP, such as CAM-B3LYP, LCB3LYP, and B3LYP-D3 result in larger errors in the optical spectra of AG-1478 in DMSO solvent.  These  B3Vc  functionals  are  reliable  tools  for  optical  properties  of  the  TKIs  and therefore the  design of new agents with larger Stokes shift for medical image applications.   1. INTRODUCTION    The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a membrane-spanning cell surface protein is a  major target for drugs in treating lung carcinoma.  Mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR  often arises in human cancers, which can cause drug sensitivity or resistance by influencing the  relative  strengths  of  drug  and  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP)  binding.  To  understand  the  mechanism of such mutations dysregulate the EGFR and to modulate its sensitivity and resistance  to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the most powerful solution is to combine experimental and  theoretical means at the molecule level.  The scaffold with the 4-quinazolinamine class of TKIs is  excellent fluorophores for optical probes of the interaction of anticancer drugs and the environment  when  interacting  with  light.  Optical  spectral  (UV-vis  and  fluorescence)  properties  of  quinazolinamine fluorophores are sensitive to the chemical environment and conformation of the  fluorophores and therefore, are ideal tools for optical reporting of inhibitors such as AG-1478 of  protein tyrosine kinases EGFR.    As a highly potent TKI, N-(3-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-4-quinazolinamine (AG-1478) has  been  studied  for  its  conformation  in  solvents  and  for  its  optical  spectra  using  combined  experimental and theoretical methods. It has been found that compared to the absorption UVvis spectrum, the fluorescence spectrum of AG-1478 is more sensitive to the solvent environment and conformer presence.  This property makes the TKIs useful as probes of electronically excited  states  in  biochemical  studies,  which  has  opened  new  possibilities  for  elucidating  molecular  mechanisms  of  photobiological  processes.   For  example,  in  a  recent  computational  study  concerning the unsubstituted flavone molecule, Marian et al.  showed that the first excited singlet  state favours a planar arrangement of the phenyl and chromone rings, in contrast to the twisted  conformation adopted in the electronic ground state.   Next,  Stokes  shift  is  an  important  property  for  bioactive  compounds  (drugs)  including  fluorescent dyes. The fluorophores are used in a broad spectrum of in vitro biological applications  owing to their optical and structural tenability, non-invasive treatment, cell compatibility, and real- time response.  Quinazoline scaffold-based TKIs are also ideal fluorescent dyes due to its large  Stokes shift (  at 129.5 nm of AG-1478 in DMSO solvent),  which is significantly larger than  many of the widely adopted fluorescent dyes, such as fluorescein, rhodamine, oxazine, and cyanine  with   ~ 30 nm.  Fluorescent dyes with small Stokes shift result in poor signal-to-noise ratio and  self-quenching on present microscope configurations. Stokes shifts of fluorophores depend on the  accuracy of both the absorption and emission, providing additional information.    Optical  spectra  of  electronic  systems  can  be  calculated  quantum  mechanically  using  the  frequency-dependent linear response (LR) time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)  method.  TD-DFT is an exact theory that relies on the analysis of the TD LR of the exact groundstate density to a TD external perturbation, which after Fourier transformation yields exact excitedstate  energies  and  oscillator  strengths.  The  derivation  of  the  Runge-Gross  theorem  and  the  subsequent formulation of a TD Kohn-Sham equation were the cornerstones in the development  of  the  TD-DFT  formalism,  which  becomes  the  most  prominent  method  for  the  calculation  of  excited states of medium-sized and large molecules since its development in 1984.  The majority  of TD-DFT applications are carried out using the vertical approximation. In this framework, one  estimates the excited state (ES) energies (and related properties) using the optimal ground-state  (GS) geometry, without exploring the ES potential energy surface. This approach can be a good  approximation  for absorption  (e.g. UV-vis)  spectral calculations. Though  TD-DFT  is an  exact  theory, it is based on the adiabatic approximation (frequency independence) and since the exact  exchange-correlation  (V )  functional  is  not  known,  approximate  V   functionals  need  to  be  employed  in  a  practical  calculation.  Both  limit  the  accuracy of  TD-DFT  calculations.   The  functionals such as B3LYP and PBE have been the most widely used V  functionals in standard  ground-state DFT applications.  The  selection of an  adequate  exchange-correlation  functional  (V ) for modelling excited state properties, however, has been the subject of many benchmark  studies.  Although general conclusions have been made, there is not universally “best” V  for TD-DFT  in all drug/molecular systems. The TD-DFT benchmark studies need to be made for a specific  class of molecular systems. For example, in the benchmarking study for up to six hybrid DFT  functionals (B3LYP, PBE0, M06, M06-2X, CAM-B3LYP, and LC-PBE), Charaf-Eddin et al. assessed the DFT functionals in light of the experimental band shapes corresponding to both the  absorption and emission spectra of a set of 20 representative conjugated compounds. They found  that all these tested functionals but LC-PBE reproduce the main experimental features for both  absorption and fluorescence of the conjugated molecules. They further noticed that the M06-2X  functional provides accurate excitation energies for problematic molecules. More recently, Bay et  al.  benchmarked up to 11 DFT V  functionals, for their performance of maximum absorption  wavelengths (λ ) of  coumarin derivatives. They discovered that the  B3LYP and APFD DFT  functionals topped the list of high performance. Shao et al.  benchmarked up to 17 commonly used  DFT  V   functionals  for  11  green  fluorescent  protein  (GFP)  chromophore  models  such  as  phydroxybenzylidene  imidazolinone  models  and  the  photoactive  yellow  protein  (PYP)  chromophore models such as p-vinyl phenol (pVP) and trans-p-coumaric acid (pCA). The TDDFT calculated vertical excitation energies of the five lowest excited singlet states were compared  with  calculations  using  the  approximate  second-order  coupled-cluster  theory level  (CC2)  with  def2-TZVP and aug-def2-TZVP basis sets.  When using the aug-def2-TZVP basis set, they found  that  B3LYP,  PBE0,  and  M06-2X  functionals  yield  similar  results  as  obtained  with  the rangeseparated functionals (CAMB3LYP, CAMh-B3LYP, ωPBE, ωhPBE0, ωPBEh, and ωB97X-D)  for the lowest excited singlet state (S1). In  many  cases,  results  obtained  with  TD-DFT  are  quite  sensitive  to  the  choice  of  the  V functionals.  Therefore,  the  reliability  of  TD-DFT  calculations  should  always  be  checked  by  comparison with either wave-function-based benchmark calculations or experimental data, as well  as by the sensitivity of the results to the  choices of V  functional.  In the present study, we  benchmark 22 DFT V  functional for the maximum absorption and emission wavelengths, as  well as the Stokes shift of AG-1478 ( ) with respect to available solution experimental optical  spectra of AG-1478 in solution.  The top DFT V  performers will be applied to study other  TKIs sharing the same scaffold.   2. METHODS AND COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS  All ground state quantum mechanical optimization and time-dependent density functional theory  (TD-DFT) calculations use the same method.  All calculations used 6-311++G(d,p) basis set (BS)  with  the  implicit  polarizable  continuum  model  (PCM).   That  is,  AG-1478  geometries  at  the  ground electronic state (S ) and first singlet excited-state (S ) in Figure 1 were optimized, using  the  LR-PCM/TD-DFT  methods  in  dimethyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO)  solvent,  followed  by  TD-DFT  calculations using the same DFT functionals (Vxc) in DMSO. The 22 DFT functionals (21 DFT  functional  plus  HF)  are  available  from  the  Gaussian  16  computational  chemistry  software  packages,  and Table S1 summarize the calculated results using different DFT Vxc functionals.  For  the  investigation  of  absorption  and  emission  processes,  two  approaches  are  usually  employed: the conventional linear-response (LR) approaches  and the state-specific (SS) ones. In  the  LR  method,  the  absorption  and  emission  energies  including  a  PCM  correction  are  determined by the electron density variation associated with the transition. All calculations were  performed using Gaussian 16 computational chemistry packages  at the supercomputing facilities  from National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) and the OzSTAR Supercomputer at Swinburne  University. The AG-1478 chemical structure in Figure 1b is the global minimum structure obtained  based on the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) model.  Analysis of the linear response of the ground-state  density was calculated either with the HF or with DFT to an external time-dependent perturbation  leads to the TD-HF or TD-DFT schemes, respectively,  where the wavefunction Hartree-Fock  (HF) calculations are employed as a reference.  3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  3.1 Performance of the DFT-VXC functionals in TD-DFT study  Although several general conclusions are available, there is no universal solution for choosing  the “best” V  for the TD-DFT calculations of all systems of interest.  As a result, it becomes a  common practice of benchmarking studies to assess the V  for calculating particular properties,  (e.g., absorption and/or emission spectra) of a particular class of compounds (e.g., quinazoline  scaffold TKIs in our case). A comprehensive review and extensive assessment of about 200 DFT-    functionals  by  Mardirossian  and  Head-Gordon   divided  the  DFT-V   functionals  approximately into three major  corrections of wave function theory, exchange-correlation, and  dispersion corrections. As many as eight energetic properties were studied such as non-covalent  “easy”  energy (NCED,  NCEC,  NCD),  isomerization  energy  (IE,  ID), thermochemistry energy  (TCE), and barrier height  (BH). The top 20  DFT-V  functional performers included SPW92,  PBE, TPSS, B3LYP; PBE-D3(BJ), revPBE-D3(BJ), BLYP-D3(BJ), B97-D3(BJ); TPSS-D3(BJ),  SCAN-D3(BJ),  M06-L,  B97M-RV;  PBE0-D3(BJ),  B3LYP-D3(BJ),  B97X-D,  B97X-V;  TPSSh-D3(BJ),  M06-2x,  MN15  and  B97M-V.   In  this  assessment,  Perdrews’  metaphorical  Jacob’s Ladder with five rungs of accuracy order of local spin-density approximation (LSDA),  are the Gaussian labeling of the atoms with R1, R2, and R3 are perimeters for the corresponding  rings of the quinazoline scaffold.   and   may produce an “accurate” Stokes shift due to the error cancellation. For example, In  Figure 2 shows that the HF method and LC-B3LYP produce larger errors in both   (blue) and  (orange) but an error in Stokes shift (grey) is small due to the cancellation.   Figure 2. Performance of DFT-V  functionals with respect to producing the accurate maximum  absorption  wavelength  (blue,     =   -   (332nm)),  emission  wavelength  (orange,   = -   (475.5nm)), Stokes shift (grey,  =  -  ), and overall error (yellow,    = | | + | | + | |) of AG-1478 in DMSO (nm). Details are presented in Table S1  of the supplementary materials.  functionals  with  poor  performance  include  CAM-B3LYP,  B97D3,  M11,  NM11,  B97XD,  with the accuracy of high-level correlated approaches such as EOM-CCSD or CASPT2,  with the  (EOM-CCSD and CASPT2) having significant computational costs.   The top-performing DFT-V  functionals demonstrate small errors of <50 nm and they are  shown  in  Figure  3.  Our  further  discussion  will  concentrate  on  the  best  performing  DFT-V functionals together with HF calculations as a reference.  Figure  3.  Top  seven  DFT-V   functional  performers  with  respect  to  accurately  producing  maximum absorption (blue,   =  -  ), emission (orange,  =  -  ), Stokes  shift (grey,  =  -   ), and overall error (yellow,   = | | + | | + | |)  of AG1478 in DMSO.   Performance of the DFT-V  functionals in term of overall error (  = | | + | | + | |)  for AG-1478 in DMSO (the smaller the better) is given as B3PW91 (4.56 nm) > B3P86 (8.22 nm)  >  B3LYP  (16.12  nm)  >  HSEH1PBE  (16.84  nm)  >N12SX  (24.04  nm)  >  AFPD  (40.58  nm)  >  PBE1PBE (52.9 nm). The results are in agreement with the recent benchmarking study of DFT-   functionals using TD-DFT calculations for the UV-Vis spectral simulation  who obtained  the following order in terms of accuracy: B3LYP > APDF > M06 > PW6B9D3 > PBE0 > BP86 >  PBE > M06-2X > CAM-B3LYP > B97XD > LC-PBE.  (244.31 nm). Note that the calculations are only based on the global minimum structure of AG1478, while it is known that other conformers can be populated under room temperature. Table 1.

The HF calculations are as a reference.  APFD yields a smaller value (  = -79.01). The twisted configuration of the ES of AG-1478 leads  to the decrease of the dipole moment, from 7-8 D in the GS to 6-7 D in the first ES. Figure 4  illustrates alignments of all optimized ES structures of AG-1478 using the top-performing DFT-   functionals.  Figure  4.

The  6311++G(d, p) basis set was used for all calculations. The HF method gave =-153.50 while the  APFD yielded the smallest dihedral angle =-79.01.  Figure 5.

According to the measured spectra of AG-1478,  the absorptions (  and   ) occur at  346 nm and 332 nm in DMSO, respectively, and the emission occurs at 475.5 nm.   Table 2. Ground state and the first excited state properties were calculated using the top seven  DFT-V  performers in DMSO*.  Expt  332  -  -  475.5  -  143.5  -    *using 6-311++G (d, p) basis set. The HF calculations serve as a reference.  #The Stokes shift was calculated as the difference between the maximum emission ( ) and  maximum absorption  ( ). This experimental  value is 475.5-332=143.5 nm.  Note that the  experiment Stokes shift is calculated using the first absorption ( ) and maximum emission ( ). Table 2 shows the maximum absorption and emission wavelengths, the Stokes shifts, and the  overall  error  of  the  top  DFT  functionals.  Some  DFT  functionals  produce  accurate  absorption  wavelengths, some are good for the emission wavelengths, some are accurate for Stokes shifts and  some  achieve  overall  small  errors.  For  example,  the  top  three  DFT  functional  for  absorption  wavelengths are B3LYP (-0.63 nm), N12SX (0.81 nm), and B3PW91 (1.39 nm). The top three  DFT  functional  for  prediction  of  the  emission  wavelengths  are  not  necessarily  the  same  as  absorption but B3P86 (1.10 nm), B3PW91 (2.28 nm), and HSEH1PBE (-6.10 nm). As for the  Stokes shifts, the top three performers are B3PW91 (0.89 nm), B3P86 (4.11 nm), and B3LYP (8.06  nm).  Finally,  the  top  three  DFT  functionals  in  terms  of  accuracy  (the  smaller  the  better)  are  B3PW91 (4.56 nm), B3P86 (8.22 nm), and B3LYP (16.12 nm). Thus, B3PW91 functional is the  top overall performer for prediction of the optical properties including absorption, emission, and  Stokes shifts. The B3LYP is excellent for absorption calculations. B3P86 is the best for emission  calculations.   4. CONCLUSION  Performance  of  twenty-one  DFT  functionals  and  the  Hartree-Fock  (HF)  theory  was  benchmarked  with  respect  to  the  measured  optical  properties  of  TKI  AG-1478  in  dimethyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO)  using  the  TD-DFT  method.  The  Becke’s  three-parameter  functionals,  B3PW91, B3LYP, and B3P86, combined with the 6-311++G(d, p) basis set demonstrated the top  overall performance in reproducing the experimental optical properties. Other DFT functionals  such as BPE1BPE, APFD, HSEH1PBE,  and N12SX  are also  among the excellent  performers.  Although B3LYP functional is a top performer, any corrections to it, such as CAM-B3LYP, LCB3LYP, and B3LYP-D3, resulted in larger errors in the optical properties of AG-1478 in DMSO.  More specifically, B3PW91 is a recommended DFT functional for studying the optical properties  of the TKI class of compounds. B3LYP is an excellent method for absorption calculations while  B3P86 is the best for emission calculations. These B3Vc functionals are reliable tools for studying  the optical properties of the TKIs and therefore for the design of new agents with larger Stokes  shift for medical image applications.     Significant  research  has  been  dedicated  to  the  improvement  and  development  of  new  V functionals to eliminate the known failures of TD-DFT.  However, a big remaining question is  that whether there exists the approximate V  functional that can describe both the ground state  and excited states equally well. Since different excited states can possess very different electronic  structures, it  seems  unlikely that  all of  them  can all  be captured  by  a  single approximate  V functional  for  all  classes  of  molecules.  The  present  benchmarking  shows  that  some  DFT  functionals may be accurate for the ground electronic state but not for the lowest excited state or  vice  versa.   Thus,  it  is  important  to  benchmark  the  DFT  functionals  for  a  particular  class  of  molecules and desired properties before production calculations.
