Dataset of Philippine presidents’ speeches from 1935 to 2016. International Journal of Computing Sciences Research, in press. doi: 10.25147/ijcsr.2017.001.1.72  Purpose – The dataset was collected to examine and identify possible key topics within these texts.  Method – Data preparation such as data cleaning, transformation, tokenization, removal of stop words from both English and Filipino, and word stemming was employed in the dataset before feeding it to sentiment analysis and the LDA model.  Results – The topmost occurring word within the dataset is "development" and there are three (3) likely topics from the speeches of Philippine presidents: economic development, enhancement of public services, and addressing challenges.  Conclusion – The dataset was able to provide valuable insights contained among official documents. While the study showed that presidents have used their annual address to express their visions for the country. It also presented that the presidents from 1935 to 2016 faced the same problems during their term.  Recommendations – Future researchers may collect other speeches made by presidents during their term; combine them to the dataset used in this study to further investigate these important texts by subjecting them to the same methodology used in this study. The dataset may be requested from the authors and it is recommended for further  John Paul P. Miranda analysis. For example, determine how the speeches of the president reflect the preamble or foundations of the Philippine constitution.  Keywords – data mining, Philippines, president, speech, text mining.  Keywords: dataset, Philippine president, speeches, data mining, quantitative text analysis, text mining, sentiment analysis, topic modeling  There are 77 annual presidents’ speeches delivered to the nation from 1935 to 2016. These were extracted from multiple sources: seventy-two (72) came from official government websites (i.e., Official Gazette of the Philippines and Presidential Communication Operations Office (PCOO)) and five (5) of them came from online news sources (i.e., ABS-CBN News, GMA News Online, Rappler). All of these speeches are in a text-based format. The dataset contains pre-cleaned and tokenized 656,873 words.  The study of Miranda and Bringula (2021) to which the dataset was fully utilized aims to analyze what possible themes or likely topics can be found from the presidents’ speeches and how do these speeches by sentiment can change over time. The study sought to answer these problems by implementing a topic model and sentiment analysis to the dataset. LDA was previously used for analyzing personality traits of social media user (Liu, Wang, & Jiang, 2016), identifying and summarization of topics on large collection of documents (Blei, 2012; Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004), classifying key themes from comments on video tutorials (Miranda and Martin, 2020), and extraction of linguistic metaphor (Heintz et al., 2013). While several studies have used sentiment analysis for analyzing important topics on political issues (Stieglitz and Dang, 2012), understanding politicians’ behavior towards social media discourse (DiGrazia et al., 2013), examining public mood towards events (Bollen et al., 2011), and determining the sentiments of YouTube learners through their feedback (Miranda & Martin, 2020; Bringula et al., 2019).  Figure 1 shows the entire data cleaning and preparation process implemented towards the 77 speeches.  It involves six (6) main parts: combining all speeches, tokenizing the combined speeches, transforming them to lowercase letters, removing numbers and special characters (i.e., "*", "#"), applying word stemming, filtering of English and Filipino stop words from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. The process resulted in the cleaned dataset which was also the corpus which consists of 656,873 words. A copy of the corpus was further subdivided per president (i.e., Arroyo: 2001-2009), this was implemented to determine the probable topics contained within presidents’ speeches. The above-mentioned process was strictly followed before subjecting the corpus to sentiment analysis and topic model. For the sentiment analysis, the study used the sentiment intensity analyzer from the NLTK library to acquire and aggregate the polarity scores (i.e., positivity and negativity of sentences) and to see the changes in the sentiment per president. For the topic modeling, the dataset was subjected to multidimensional scaling to visualize how many topics can be inferred based on their inter-topic distances. The authors then decided after careful deliberation on the probable labels.  Figure 1. Step by step process of data preparation implemented to the speeches  The researchers have used NLTK’s Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) to perform the sentiment analysis in the dataset. VADER sentiment analysis is known for its simplicity and effectiveness (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014). While Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model was used to discover topic clusters from the dataset. LDA is recognized for its usefulness and popularity as a technique for topic modeling (Jelodar et al., 2019). Both models implement bag-of-words. Figure 2 indicates that the most occurring word within the corpus is the word “development”. Table 1 shows how each top occurring words was used.  Figure 2.

Table 2 shows a sample of positive and negative sentences using sentiment analysis.  Table 2. Sample sentence that shows Positive and Negative Sentiments during the SONA  Table 2. Sample sentence that shows Positive and Negative Sentiments during the SONA (continuation)  Table 3 presents how the sentiments in the presidents' speeches can change from their first and final speeches.  Figure 4. Comparison of Sentiment Values (in percent) between the First and Last  Figure 4 indicates that in terms of percent changed in sentiment values between first and last SONA, it was Aquino III who have the highest positivity changed (344%) while Quirino was the only president to lower positivity when compared to his last SONA (-56%).  Figure 5 and Table 4 shows that there are there (3) likely key topics within the dataset: economic development (38%), enhancement of public services (8%), and addressing challenges (54%).  0 “economy”,  “Community development shall be pursued with greater momentum and depth to develop a new sense of values and to further strengthen our social, economic, and political base in an atmosphere of mass participation and mass involvement.” – Marcos Economic “Greater efforts should be made to Development diffuse the benefits and balance the economic development among the rural regions of the country.” – Garcia “In this endeavor we have addressed ourselves, first of all, to the task of rural development.” – Magsaysay  1 “need”,  2 “national”,  Table 5 illustrates the inferred topics per president and which of these topics can be highly attributed to each president.  “We should give full support to the improvement of instruction and facilities in public agricultural, trade, and technical schools.” – Magsaysay “Indeed the challenge of adequacy on the basic complements of public service and Enhancement physical facilities seems insurmountable; of Public and our need for public works seems Services unlimited.” – Marcos “To provide employment to long unemployed people, the construction of public works projects in the troubled area was speeded up.” – Quirino  “The welfare of the people of those areas will be safeguarded.” – Roxas “You must drop all your criminal activities because terrorism, bombings, and violence have no place in a civilized Addressing society.” – Estrada Challenges “Given our limited resources, we must improve our ratio of patrols to contacts, and our capability to maximize such combat opportunities as present themselves.” - Aquino  It shows that official documents can contain meaningful information waiting to be discovered and data mining methods particularly sentiment analysis and LDA model can be used to understand these large textual data. The study was able to determine the key topics within the presidents’ speeches from 1935 to 2016. These speeches are likely to focus on three main themes: economic development, enhancement of public services, and addressing challenges. The findings provided a glimpse of how Philippine presidents used their annual addresses to portray their visions for the country. The analysis further implied that from 1935 to 2016, the presidents are trying to solve and address the same perennial problems.  Future researchers may collect other official speeches made by a president during their term and subject them to the same methodology used in this study. Furthermore, the dataset may be requested from the authors for further analysis and comparison. For example, how speeches either in part or in whole reflect the preamble or foundations of  The authors are indebted to Don Honorio Ventura State University and to the University of the East for funding this study.
