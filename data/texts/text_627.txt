Collaboration between the AI/Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction communities can enable humancentered AI  Wei Xu, Marvin Dainoff developed. Current development is mainly driven by a “technology-centered design” approach failures. The AI Incident Database has documented over a thousand AI-related accidents developing AI must follow a human-centered AI (HCAI) approach, based on collaboration between the AI/computer science (CS) and human-computer interaction (HCI) communities.  approach,” ignoring the needs of ordinary users and causing usability problems. With an initiative primarily driven by a collaboration by the professionals of human factors, CS, and psychology, a new field of HCI emerged. Such an interdisciplinary collaborative field has benefited the promotion of a “human-centered design” approach. History now seems to be repeating, having brought the AI/CS and HCI communities to a new juncture. This time the consequences of ignoring the “human-centered design” are even more serious.   AI has unique characteristics compared to non-AI systems. huge investments in the ethics of AI systems, acknowledging the value of identifying human-centered principles that can guide how AI systems are deployed. The HCI community has been applying the human-centered approach to computing systems but face some challenges in applying it to AI systems. communities work together to develop human-centered AI systems?

Further, Xu (2019) and Shneiderman (2020) proposed comprehensive HCAI frameworks across the three aspects of human, technology, and ethics for developing human-centered AI systems (see Figure).  Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought benefits, but it may also cause harm if it is not appropriately  When personal computers (PCs) emerged in the 1980s, their development followed a “technology-centered  In 2018, Stanford University established an interdisciplinary institute to initiate a “human-centered AI ultimate decision makers with AI systems.  The new opportunities to start a joint journey for collaboration interaction with AI systems, we conducted a study to assess the transition between the two types of interaction under five aspects (see the selected results in Table): (1) identify the major transitions from human interaction with non-AI to AI systems; (2) map the HCAI design goals across these transitions; (3) identify the challenges in developing AI systems to achieve the HCAI goals; (4) analyze the current AI/CS approaches and challenges to achieve the HCAI goals; (5) analyze the contributions of HCI approaches to achieve the HCAI goals.

The approaches taken by each    The Human-Centered AI (HCAI) design approach [x]   (1) Human: We need to start from user needs and apply human-centered processes and methods to develop  AI systems that are useful and explainable.  (2) Technology: We need to integrate human roles and build more scalable and powerful hybrid intelligence by taking the complementary advantages of human and machine intelligence. The design goals are to develop human-controllable AI and augment human abilities instead of replacing them.  (3) Ethics: We must guarantee fairness, justice, privacy, and accountability through interdisciplinary approaches to develop ethical and responsible AI.  Thus, the HCAI approach places humans at the center of the development, ensuring that humans are the  To better understand the current transition of from traditional human interaction with non-AI systems to  This viewpoint is a summary of the analyses in a recent article in the International Journey of Human community show their individual work focus. More importantly, AI/CS and HCI can complement each other in achieving the HCAI design goals.  that eventually leads to developing human-centered AI systems.

Consequently, recommendations from HCI professionals could be easily ignored by AI professionals. that many ease-of-use issues for UI design that HCI could not solve in the past have been solved through AI technology (e.g., voice input). However, studies have shown that the outcomes followed by a technology-driven approach may not be acceptable from the perspective of usability. challenging to collaborate effectively. Recent studies have shown that HCI professionals do not seem to be prepared to provide effective design support for AI systems due to lack of AI knowledge, while AI professionals may not fully understand the purpose behind HCI work. Recommendations for the shared journey of enabling HCAI communities a few decades ago, William Howell (2011) proposed a “shared philosophy” which intersects humancentered design philosophy with other disciplines. disciplines in the field of HCI for promoting the design philosophy is the embodiment of this model. need to enhance current processes for developing AI systems by incorporating HCI processes and methods as well as enhancing current software methodology so that members from diverse disciplines can collaborate to attain shared goals with complementary methods. also need to understand AI technology and apply it to facilitate the collaboration. Such a mutual understanding from an interdisciplinary perspective will overcome their lack of ability to influence on AI systems as reported today. AI/CS professionals also need to obtain the necessary knowledge from HCI, behavioral and social sciences.  factors and psychology have provided an extensive array of professional capabilities, contributing to a mature user experience culture. For this to occur for HCAI, new measures at the level of colleague education are required, including cultivating interdisciplinary skills, such as providing students with multiple options of a hybrid curriculum of “HCI + AI,” or “AI major + social science minor.”  benefited by interdisciplinary collaboration. We advocate further collaborative projects for developing AI systems across disciplines and domains. The development of autonomous vehicles is a good example. Many companies currently have heavily invested in developing autonomous vehicles, there are opportunities for collaboration to overcome many challenges.  As an emerging approach, HCAI will face challenges in practice. Research shows that while HCI  1) Share a common design philosophy. In response to the challenges faced by the interdisciplinary  2) Apply an integrated interdisciplinary approach to enable HCAI. To enable HCAI in practice, we  3) Update skillset and knowledge.

The development of AI technology itself has been management commitment, organizational culture, optimized development process, design standards and governance, and so on. We firmly believe that a mature HCAI culture will eventually come into being, and history has proven our initial success in promoting the human-centered design philosophy through collaboration in the PC era.    influence ultimately determines our continuing efforts, just as the culture of user experience has been jointly promoted over the last forty years. We thus find ourselves at a new historical junction, which requires a new journey of collaboration across the AI/CS and HCI communities for enabling the HCAI approach.
