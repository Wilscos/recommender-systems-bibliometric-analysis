Kento Asai,Koichi Hamaguchi,Natsumi Nagata, Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (Kavli IPMU), University of Tokyo, Kashiwa 277–8583, Japan The latest measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment (g − 2) of muon by the Fermilab Muon g − 2 Experiment [1], combined with the previous result by the BNL E821 experiment [2], shows that the measured value of the muon g − 2 deviates from the value calculated in the Standard Model (SM) [3] by 4.2σ. The largest uncertainty in the SM calculation at the present moment comes from the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution. In Ref. [3], the Muon g −2 Theory Initiative determined the HVP contribution from eedata. A recent lattice QCD simulation [4], however, found a value of the HVP contribution larger than that presented in Ref. [3], which considerably relaxes the g − 2 discrepancy. It is, thus, of great importance to improve the determination of the HVP contribution in order to clarify the situation. The MUonE experiment [5, 6] aims at determining the HVP contribution with a method [7] diﬀerent from the aforementioned ones. In this experiment, muons with an energy of 150 GeV collide with electrons at rest. Through precise measurements of the diﬀerential scattering cross sections of the µe → µe process, the size of the HVP contribution in space-like momentum regions is extracted, from which one can determine the HVP contribution to the muon g − 2. The precision of this evaluation is expected to be comparable to or smaller than the present uncertainty in the calculation of the HVP contribution and, in particular, is smaller than the size of the g − 2 discrepancy by about an order of magnitude. A test run of the MUonE experiment is scheduled in 2021 [8]; if it is successful, full running may be performed in 2022–24 [9]. In the meantime, there have been a variety of proposals to explain the muon g −2 discrepancy in models beyond the SM. A simple, successful class of models are based Shih-Yen Tseng,and Juntaro Wada gauge boson at the MUonE experiment. The . The Zin the ﬁnal state decays into on the L− Lgauge theory [10–13], where a massive gauge boson associated with this gauge symmetry, called the L− Lgauge boson (Z), contributes to the muon magnetic moment at one-loop level. This type of gauge theory was ﬁrst considered as a potential way to promote a global symmetry in the SM to a gauge symmetry. As it turns out, this gauge theory allows the introduction of right-handed neutrinos as well. Moreover, a minimal setup with three right-handed neutrinos is found to provide a neutrino-mass structure compatible with the current neutrino experimental data [14–17], even though it is highly constrained by this gauge symmetry due to its ﬂavor dependence [18–23]. As discussed in a number of previous studies [24–74], the observed value of the muon g −2 discrepancy can be explained by the L−Lgauge models while evading the current experimental limits, for a mass of Zin the range m∼ 10–200 MeV. As the MUonE experiment is designed to determine the HVP contribution with a precision much better than the 4.2σ discrepancy, one may expect that it is also sensitive to the new physics contributions accounting for the discrepancy. This expectation, however, turns out to be generically incorrect—as shown in Refs. [75–77], the measurement of the µe → µe elastic scattering at the MUonE experiment is actually insensitive to new physics eﬀects. In particular, the contribution of Zin the L−Lmodels to the µe → µe process, which is induced at one-loop level, is smaller than the HVP contribution by orders of magnitude, and the parameter regions where this measurement has sensitivities have already been excluded by other experiments. Nevertheless, we point out in this letter that we can probe the L− Lmodels at the MUonE experiment by searching for the signature associated with the direct production of Z, µe → µeZ. The MUonE experiment [5, 6] plans to use the 150 GeV muon beam at the CERN North Area, with the target being electrons in beryllium atoms. The experimental apparatus consists of a series of 40 stations, each of which has a 15 mm thick Be target and tracking sensors. Right after these 40 stations, an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is located. A muon ﬁlter with muon chambers is placed at the end. See Letter of Intent [6] for more details on the detector setup and its projected performance. The primary target of the MUonE experiment is the elastic scattering process, µe → µe, where the initialstate electron is at rest. Given the initial energy of muon E= 150 GeV, the energies and the scattering angles of the ﬁnal-state electron and muon are determined as functions of one parameter. For example, the muon scattering angle θis related to the electron scattering angle where R ≡ (m+ mE)/(m+ mE) with mand mthe masses of muon and electron, respectively, and√√ γ ≡ (m+ E)/s withs the center-of-mass energy: In addition, the ﬁnal-state electron energy Eis given by with β ≡E− m/(E+ m). From Eq. (1), we see that there is a maximum value of θ, θ=√ 1/(γR− 1) ' 4.84 mrad. Suppose that we require θto be larger than a certain threshold value θ< θ. This restricts θ, and thus Eas well, to be in a ﬁnite range, according to Eq. (1) and Eq. (3), respectively. In particular, the maximum value of θwithin this range corresponds to the minimum value of Efor θ> θ, which we denote by E; in Fig. 1, we plot Eas a function of θ. Another process that could contaminate the elastic scattering process is the µe → µeγ process. For later use, we consider the minimum value of E≡ E+ E under the condition θ> θ, where Eis the energy of the ﬁnial-state photon. To obtain this, we deﬁne m≡ (p+ p), where pand pare the four-momenta of the ﬁnal-state electron and photon, respectively. In the center-of-mass frame, this quantity is evaluated as√ m= s + m− 2sE, with Ethe out-going muon energy in this frame. We see that E, and therefore Eas well, is maximized for a minimum value of m. This consequence does not depend on the muon scattering angle. Because of the energy-conservation law, Eis θ> θas a function of θfor µe → µe (µe → µeγ). The vertical dashed and horizontal dotted lines correspond to the threshold values of θand Ewe require for our selection criteria, respectively. minimized when Eis maximized; hence, the minimum value of Eis obtained when mis minimized. Now note that m> m, and m→ mfor E→ 0, i.e., in the soft photon limit. Since this limit corresponds to the elastic scattering discussed above, we conclude that E> Efor θ> θ, and thus Fig. 1 can also be regarded as the lower limit on Ein the µe → µeγ process under the condition θ> θ.√ From Eq. (2), we haves ' 406 MeV. This means that we can create a new particle at the MUonE if its mass is . 300 MeV. In particular, the L− Lgauge boson with a mass m. 300 MeV can be produced through the process µe → µeZ. The Zdecays into a pair of neutrinos, and therefore cannot be observed directly. We, however, show below that it is still possible to detect this signature if we impose appropriate selection conditions. Let us now describe the search strategy and show its prospects for the Zanalysis. To remove the SM background processes, we impose the following selection criteria: (i) θ> 1.5 mrad. (ii) 1 GeV < E< 25 GeV. (iii) Photon veto. Note that θcan be measured with a resolution of O(0.01) mrad at the MUonE. Eand Eare measured by the ECAL, which is expected to oﬀer an energy resolution of . 10%. We show the minimum value of θin (i) and the maximum value of Ein (ii) in the vertical dashed and horizontal dotted lines in Fig. 1, respectively. From this plot, it can be immediately seen that the elastic scattering process never occurs under the conditions (i) and (ii); with (i), the minimum value of Eis ' 38 GeV, which is out of the range of (ii). The µe → µeγ process can occur under the conditions (i) and (ii), but in this case Emust be larger than 38 GeV − E& 13 GeV. Such an energetic photon can be detected at the ECAL if the ﬁnal-state electron and photon are well separated,and thus would be vetoed by the condition (iii). We can show that the photon is emitted in the forward direction, θ. 6 mrad; the present design of the MUonE experiment supposes the ECAL transverse dimension of O(1 ×1) m[6], with which all the photons are expected to hit the ECAL. If, on the other hand, the electron and photon cannot be distinguished in the ECAL, they are detected as a single electron having energy larger than 38 GeV—this event is eliminated by the condition (ii). Therefore, both the µe → µe and µe → µeγ processes can be safely removed with our selection criteria, just by kinematics. Other potential background sources include multiple scattering associated with the µe → µe process, muonnuclear scattering, and µe → µeν¯ν induced by the electroweak gauge boson exchange. The signiﬁcance of the ﬁrst two strongly depends on the experimental setup, which is not fully ﬁxed yet; hence, the evaluation of the number of events associated with these background FIG. 2. Distribution of Eof signal events for the two choices of the parameter points under the condition (i) for an integrated luminosity of 15 fb. Gray shaded regions are out of the range of the condition (ii). sources is beyond the scope of this letter. We, however, expect that these two can be well controlled. Multiple scattering may mimic the signal-like signature if the muon scattering angle satisﬁes the condition (i) and the electron loses its energy by a subsequent scattering to fall into the signal range (ii); or the ﬁnal-state electron energy is within the range (ii) and the muon undergoes a second scattering so that its scattering angle gets larger to satisfy (i). In both cases, there should be a sizable energy deposit at the second scattering point, which can be detected as a kink/branch of the track. For Muon-nuclear scattering events, they are expected to be identiﬁed by using track multiplicity as discussed in Ref. [6]. On the contrary, the electroweak processes for µe → µeν¯ν cannot be eliminated by the kinematical cuts, since they yield the same ﬁnal state as that of µe → µeZ. We thus compute the number of these events using Monte Carlo simulations. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of Eof signal events under the condition (i) for two sets of parameters: m= 100 MeV and g= 10(green); and m= 10 MeV and g= 5 × 10(blue). The gauge coupling gisP deﬁned by the Lagrangian L= −gZQ¯ψγψ, where Zis the L− Lgauge boson and Q= 1 (−1) for ψ being the second (third) generation leptons. These parameter points can explain the observed muon g−2 discrepancy, as shown below. To simulate the signal events, we use FeynRules v2.3.48 [78, 79] to generate the UFO ﬁle for our model and MadGraph5 aMC@NLO v3.1.1 [80] for Monte Carlo simulations. Here we assume an integrated luminosity of 15 fb, which is expected to be reached in a few years of data taking [6]. As we see, FIG. 3. Contour of the number of signal events for an integrated luminosity of 15 fb, N, under the conditions (i–iii) in the m–gplane. The orange and yellow bands show the muon g − 2 favored regions at the 1σ and 2σ levels, respectively. The two red stars are the benchmark points used in Fig. 2. The green, gray, dark blue, and light blue shaded areas are excluded by BABAR [81], Borexino [82], CHARM-II [83], and CCFR [84], respectively. the ﬁnal-state electrons tend to be softer for a larger Z mass. In both cases shown in this ﬁgure, a large number of events remain after further imposing the condition (ii), which is shown in the gray shade: ' 600 (1200) events for m= 10 MeV (100 MeV). We also ﬁnd that the electrons are scattered dominantly into the forward region (θ. 20 mrad) and thus most of them are expected to hit the ECAL.On the other hand, the number of events for the electroweak processes µe → µeν ¯ν, which is also computed with MadGraph5 aMC@NLO v3.1.1, is found to be negligibly small: ∼ 10events for the same integrated luminosity, 15 fb. To show the potential impact of our search strategy, in Fig. 3, we show the contours of the number of signal events for an integrated luminosity of 15 fb, N, under the conditions (i–iii) in the m–gplane. The orange and yellow bands correspond to the parameter regions where the observed value of the muon g − 2 discrepancy can be explained at the 1σ and 2σ levels, respectively. The two red stars are the benchmark points used in Fig. 2, which are found to be within the 1σ band. The green-shaded area is excluded by the BABAR experiment [81]. The Belle experiment gives a similar limit in this region [85]. The gray-shaded region is disfavored by the neutrino-electron scattering data obtained at the Borexino experiment [82]; we take this bound from the result given in Ref. [44]. The blue dark (light) shaded region represents the limit from the neutrino trident production processes imposed by the CHARMII [83] (CCFR [84]) experiment, taken from Ref. [28]. As seen in this ﬁgure, we expect ∼ 10signal events in the muon g − 2 favored region. For low-mass regions, O(1) events are obtained for gas small as a few ×10. For m& 100 MeV, the number of events is suppressed kinematically, and vanishes at m' 300 MeV. We have discussed the prospects of probing the L−L gauge boson at the MUonE experiment, by searching for events with (i) θ> 1.5 mrad and (ii) 1 GeV < E< 25 GeV. For the SM background, elastic scattering events, µe → µe, do not yield such a signature as a large muon scattering angle is always accompanied by an energetic electron. The µe → µeγ process can give rise to this signature only when a hard photon exists, and thus can be removed by requiring (iii) a photon veto. The number of events of the electroweak process µe → µeν ¯ν turns out to be negligibly small. We ﬁnd that the number of signal events µe → µeZis as large as ∼ 10in the parameter region motivated by the muon g − 2 discrepancy. It is, therefore, quite feasible to probe the L− Lgauge boson at the MUonE experiment, without introducing additional devices, and we strongly recommend recording the events relevant to this Zproduction process. It is possible to improve our selection criteria (i–iii), by optimizing the threshold values and using additional variables, such as θ, acoplanarity, etc. Such an optimization can be considered once the detector setup is fully ﬁxed and its performance is well understood. Moreover, an additional detector to measure the muon energy/momentum could be useful to improve the search strategy; with this, we can easily detect the missingenergy carried by Z. We also note that with such a detector, it is in principle possible to fully reconstruct the four momentum of the produced Zand, in particular, to measure its mass. The size of gcan also be estimated from the number of events. This information allows us to test the explanation of the muon g − 2 discrepancy with the L− Lgauge models. There are other potential SM background processes not quantitatively discussed in this work, due to the lack of knowledge on the actual experimental setup and detector performance. Although we expect they are controllable as argued above, the validation of this argument and precise evaluation of the number of events associated with the processes are certainly required. We will return to these and other issues in the future.
