This paper considers the Liu estimator in the multinomial logistic regression model. We propose some different estimators of the biasing parameter. The mean square error (MSE) is considered as the performance criterion. In order to compare the performance of the estimators, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation study. According to the results of the simulation study, we found that increasing the correlation between the independent variables and the number of regressors has a negative effect on the MSE. However, when the sample size increases the MSE decreases even when the correlation between the independent variables is large. Based on the minimum MSE criterion some useful estimators for estimating the biasing parameter d are recommended for the practitioners.

When this problem occurs in multiple linear regression, it is not convenient to estimate the parameters by using the ordinary least squared (OLS) method due to the large variance and the instability of the OLS method. Similarly, in binary and multinomial logistic regression models the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method has these drawbacks. Thus, the inferences based on the regression analysis may not be trustworthy. multiple linear regression model. In literature, many researchers have proposed different ridge estimators. To mention a few, Kibria (2003), Khalaf and Shukur (2005), Alkhamisi et al. (2006),  Alkhamisi and Shukur (2007), Muniz and Kibria (2009), Månsson et al. (2010), Muniz et al. (2012). In ridge regression, a small positive number k is added to the diagonal entries of the correlation matrix coefficients. However, there is a disadvantage of the ridge estimator such that the estimated parameters are non-linear functions of the ridge parameter be large enough to overcome multicollinearity. function of the shrinkage parameter Stein estimator Stein (1956).  used statistical analysis in many fields. Moreover, there is a growing interest in the problem of multicollinearity for the logistic regression model. We recommend the following studies: In Schaefer et al. (1984), a logistic ridge estimator was proposed for this problem. Månsson and  In linear regression, the multicollinearity problem occurs when the explanatory  Hoerl and Kennard (1970) suggested the ridge regression to solve this problem in the  Liu (1993) proposed the Liu estimator which has the advantage of being a linear  Logistic regression, being a kind of generalized linear model, is one of the most widely  Shukur (2011) and Kibria et al. (2012) proposed many ridge estimators to be used in logistic ridge regression. Månsson et al. (2012) proposed to generalize the Liu estimator to the binary logistic regression model. Huang (2012) also proposed a two-parameter estimator in logistic regression. Inan and Erdogan (2013) proposed the Liu-type logistic estimators by generalizing the Liu-type estimator (Liu, 2003) to the binary logistic regression model. Asar and Genç (2016) proposed some new shrinkage estimators for the Liu-type logistic estimator.  models so far. One exception is the paper of Månsson et al. (2018) in which the authors proposed to use ridge regression when there is a multicollinearity problem in the multinomial logistic regression. They conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the performance of the existing ridge estimators and the MLE using the mean squared error (MSE) criterion. Another exception is that Abonazel and Farghali (2019) proposed a two-parameter estimator including both ridge and Liu estimators in the multinomial logistic regression. multinomial logistic regression and propose some methods to estimate the shrinkage parameter $ used in multinomial logistic Liu estimator (MLLE) to combat multicollinearity in the multinomial logistic regression model. Liu estimator with the proposed shrinkage estimators is assumed to perform much better than the maximum likelihood estimation when the explanatory variables are correlated. We design a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of the estimators. Mean squared error (MSE) is used to compare the estimators as a performance criterion. and the proposed shrinkage estimators. The details of the Monte Carlo experiment are given in Section 3. We provide the results and discussions of the simulation in Section 4. An application of real data is demonstrated in Section 5. Finally, a summary and conclusion are presented.  However, multicollinearity has not been studied in the multinomial logistic regression  The purpose of this paper is to generalize the Liu estimator (Liu, 1993) to the  This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the model, the methodology,  When the dependent variable consists of logistic regression model developed by Luce (1959) is one of the most popular statistical methods.

Due to this problem,  becomes unstable and has large standard errors. ˆ Since the variance of MLE is inflated, we propose to use the logistic Liu estimator (Månsson et al., 2012) to decrease the variance in the multinomial logistic model. Although Abonazel and Farghali (2019) mentioned slightly about the multinomial version of the Liu estimator, following Månsson et al. (2012), we define the multinomial logistic Liu (MLL) estimator as follows: and  Månsson et al. (2012) showed that there is always a value of  between zero and one so that  2.3.

Design of the simulation In this section, we present the details and the results of the Monte Carlo simulation which is conducted to evaluate the performances of the estimators MLL and MLE. We refer to the following papers to design the simulation Lee and Silvapulle (1988), Asar and Genç (2016), and Månsson et al.

To compute the simulated MSEs of the estimators, the following equation is used respectively:  The simulated MSE values of the estimators are reported in Tables 1-4. According to the tables, we can make the following conclusions:  • It is observed that increasing the degree of correlation affects the estimators negatively, namely, their MSE values increases. Especially, the MSE of MLE is inflated when the degree of correlation is increased. The least affected estimator is MLL with $ from this situation.  • Moreover, we observe that increasing the sample size makes a positive effect on the  • It can also be observed from tables that if we increase the number of explanatory  • Furthermore, we also observe that when the degree of correlation is 0.9 and the sample  • Overall, MLL with estimators.

Each plant’s scientific name, the number of leaf specimens by species, and the texture features of leaves analyze are given in Table 5. The correlation matrix of the texture features of leaves is given in Table 6. When the correlation matrix is examined, it is seen that there are high correlations between texture features. The square root of the ratio between the maximum and min eigenvalue of the correlation matrix for explanatory variables is called condition number (CN).  Since there are two weight matrices in the multinomial model, we compute the condition numbers of each matrix as CN1=384.845 and CN2=598.147. The values of CN between 10 and 30 indicate the presence of multicollinearity and when a value is larger than 30, the multicollinearity is regarded as strong (Kim, 2019). Therefore, we conclude that there is a strong multicollinearity problem with leaf data.

We compute MLE and MLL estimators with the proposed estimates of the biasing parameter of coefficients, their standard errors and estimated MSE values of MLE and the proposed Liu estimators are given in Table 7. According to Table 7, the standard errors and the MSE values of the proposed Liu estimators are smaller than the MLE.  Moreover, we plot the estimated MSE values for each level according to different values of the biasing parameter according to MLE and proposed Liu- estimators are given in Figure 2. According to this figure, it is readily observed that the multinomial Liu estimator has a lower MSE value for each level.  Figure 1. Estimated MSE values according to different values of the biasing parameter  This paper generalizes the well-known Liu estimator to the multinomial logistic regression model. We obtain the scalar mean squared error of the estimators MLE and MLL. Since there is biasing parameter (2012) to estimate this parameter. A Monte Carlo simulation is designed to investigate the performance of MLL and MLE in the presence of different degrees of multicollinearity. Moreover, a real data example is presented to illustrate the findings of the paper. According to both the results of simulation and real application, we conclude that MLL has a better performance than MLE in multicollinear situations. Therefore, we recommend MLL to the researchers.
