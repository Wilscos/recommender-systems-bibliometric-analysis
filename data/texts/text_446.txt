Oxide scale formed on the surface of steel products during high-temperature processes is studied as a composite material, the main solid components of which, in general, are wüstite, magnetite, hematite and metallic iron. To estimate the density of each of these components in the temperature range from 0 °C to  1300 ºС, formulas are proposed that are consistent with the empirical functions of the coefficient of linear thermal expansion, which the author obtained earlier by generalizing data from open sources. The Curie and polymorphic transformation temperatures are included in these generalized formulas as variable parameters, which allows one to take into account the movability of phase transitions due to impurities, crystal lattice defects, particle sizes, cooling rate, and other factors. When specifying the particular values of critical temperatures, the other parameters of the formulas are recalculated automatically. In a particular form, the proposed formulas correspond to the basic values of critical temperatures. According to the calculation examples given, the true (not including pores) density of oxide scale can be about 5200 to 5600 kg·m, depending on the temperature and percentage of components, whereby a local density minimum may be observed in the region of 570 °C due to eutectoid decomposition of wüstite into magnetite and iron. The proposed methods are recommended for use in mathematical simulation of processing of steel products in the presence of oxide scale on its surface.  Keywords: density; wüstite; magnetite; hematite; oxide scale; Curie point  Thermal and physical properties of surface oxide scale, including its density, are of great importance in the production and processing of steel products. Based on experimental data on the density of rolling mill scale at room temperature [1-4; 5, p. 49-50; 6, p. 102], we can assume that in different technological processes of heating, cooling and deformation of steel the density of oxide scale on its surfaces varies in the range from about 3700 kg·m to 5700 kg·m depending on its porosity, structural composition and temperature.  At the same time, in mathematical models of such processes, the density of oxide scale and/or individual oxides, that make up its composition, are now taken into account by some constant values that do not depend on the temperature [7-15]. And the values accepted by different authors may differ significantly. For example, in [8, p. 54] the density of wüstite (FeO) is taken equal to 5500 kg·m, in [12] - 5745 kg·m, and in [9-11] - 7750 kg·m. The assumption of constancy of the density of oxide scale and/or its components is undoubtedly justified in many cases of engineering calculations. However, there are problems, for example, in modeling thermal processes, in which such an approach can lead to large additional errors. To obtain correct computational estimates, it is necessary to take into account that the densities of individual oxides and scale as a whole actually depend on temperature. In this case, it is important that for each component of oxide scale its density estimates are consistent with the data on its other properties. To do this, three conditions should be met: 1) estimates of density and other thermophysical properties should be based on a generalization of different empirical data (rather than one specific study); 2) estimates of density and thermal expansion should be based on the same data (since these properties are physically related to each other); 3) for a given component of oxide scale, the density value should be estimated at the same values of phase transition temperatures as for other thermal physical parameters. The latter is explained by the fact that phase transitions are usually accompanied by a sharp change in properties, and even small difference in the temperatures of a same phase transition taken in estimation of density and, for example, thermal expansion, can lead to inconsistency in the calculated estimates of these properties. Based on the above, the author set the goal to obtain generalized formulas for calculating the density of the main structural components of oxide scale, consistent with the data on their thermal expansion. As the target temperature range the range traditional for mass processes of metal production and processing from 0 ºC to 1300 ºC was taken.  Oxide scale on the surface of steel products is studied as a composite material, the main components of which, in general, are: wüstite FeO (more precisely, FeO, where x ≈ 0.05...0.15), magnetite FeO, hematite FeO, metallic iron, oxides of alloying elements and gas voids [5, с. 8, 46; 16; 17]. The following temperatures are considered critical: for FeOand FeO- the magnetic transition temperatures (Curie points), for iron - the Curie point and the temperature of the polymorphic (α ↔ γ) transformation, and for FeO - the temperature of its eutectoid decomposition into magnetite and metallic iron (Chaudron point). The movability ranges and the accepted basic values for these critical temperatures are given in [18]. To estimate the temperature dependence of the density of solid components of oxide scale ρ(T), we used the well-known relationship for anisotropic materials: where ρ is the density of a given component at some initial temperature T (i.e. ρ ≡ ρ(T));  is the mean Coefficient of Linear Thermal Expansion (CLTE) of a given component in the interval from T to T. It was taken into account that formula (1) is valid only for temperature intervals that do not include polymorphic transformations, at which the density of the material changes by leaps. For consistency purposes formulas for calculating the mean CLTE of the components of oxide scale were obtained by integrating functions for the true CLTE, rather than by independently approximating the primary data for the mean coefficient . In other words, formulas are based on the integral: where α(T) is a function of the true CLTE of a given component, obtained in [18].  It is known that magnetite exists in only one polymorphic state [19, p. 32]. Therefore, the dependence of magnetite density on temperature in the entire target range from 0 °C to 1300 ° C can be described by a single formula of the form (1): where  [kg·m] and  [kg·m] are the density of magnetite at the current temperature T [K] and at 293 K (20 °C), respectively;  [K] is the mean CLTE of magnetite in the temperature range from 293 K to T. Based on known data (Table 1), the density of magnetite at 293 K (20 °C) in engineering calculations is recommended to be taken as:     (4)  Table 1.

Each row of this table contains FeO density values obtained according to the formulas of Table 2 for the same design temperature, but at different values of the Curie point within the real range of its variability from 823 to 900 K (i.e., from 550 to 627 ºC - see [18]). It can be seen that the density of FeO at the same temperature may be varied by up to 12 kg·m depending on the position of the Curie point.  Table 3.

The obtained values are slightly higher than the recommendations of Touloukian [37, p. 482] due to the fact that we accepted a higher density of wüstite at room temperature  (5700 kg·mvs. 5550 kg·m). temperature (values on the horizontal axis) calculated by formulas (11)-(14).

The empirical points are conventionally connected by straight lines  Iron oxide FeO in steel scale in the temperature range from 0 °C to 1300 ° C under normal pressure can be present only in one crystalline form [19]. Therefore, the change in the density of hematite can be described by a formula of the form (1):  where  [kg·m] and  [kg·m] are the density of hematite at the current temperature T [K] and at 293 K (20 °C), respectively;  [K] is the mean CLTE of wustite in the temperature range from 293 K to T.

Table 6: Formulas for calculating the mean CLTE of FeOfrom 293 K (20 °C) to the current temperature T (T In the temperature range of interest from 0 °C to 1300 °C iron undergoes two phase transitions: magnetic at the basic value of the Curie point T = 1043 K (770 ºC) and polymorphic at the basic temperature under equilibrium conditions T= 1185 K (912 ºC). The magnetic transition occurs without changing the crystal lattice. During polymorphic transformation, the lattice type and dimensions change from face-centered cubic (γ-Fe) above T to body-centered cubic (α-Fe) below T. Therefore, the dependence of iron density on temperature is described by a piecewise smooth function with a discontinuity at the point T: − below the polymorphic transformation temperature: 273 K ≤ T ≤ T (α-Fe)  − above the polymorphic transformation temperature: T < T ≤ 1573 K (γ-Fe) where T [K] is the design temperature; T [K] is the temperature of polymorphic transformation of iron; ρ [kg·m] is the density of iron at the design temperature;  [kg·m] is the density of α-iron at 293 K (20 °C);  [kg·m] is the density of γ-iron at temperature T;  [K] – mean CLTE of α-iron from  293 K to the design temperature T;  [K] - mean CLTE of γ-iron from temperature T to the design temperature T.      The value of iron density at 293 K (20 °C) in formula (21) is recommended to be taken as equal [51, с. 53; 37, с. 443]:     (23) The mean CLTE of α-iron involved in formula (21) was determined on the basis of integrating functions for the true CLTE coefficient of iron α [18] in two temperature intervals: below Curie point (T) and between Curie and polymorphic transformation points T.

The graph of iron density calculated from the above formulas at the basic values of critical temperatures T= 1043 K (770 ºC) and T= 1185 K (912 ºC), compared with some data from other sources, is shown in Fig. 5. In the range of 800-1300 °С the obtained values of iron density are higher than according to Touloukian's recommendations [37, p. 443] due to the fact that our approximation takes into account the reduction of thermal expansion coefficient in the Curie point area.  Calculations of iron density at different values of critical temperatures using formulas from Table 7 show that the shift of the Curie point within the real range of 1032-1046 K (759-773 ºC) practically does not influence the density of iron, while the mobility of polymorphic transformation may result in a change of iron density at a fixed temperature by up to 75 kg·m due to a jump change in the crystal lattice parameters.  The true (i.e., excluding pores) density of oxide scale as a multicomponent material can be represented as: where ρ is the true density of oxide scale; m is the mass of a given amount of scale, which without pores would occupy the volume V; ρ, ρ, …- the density of the 1-st, 2-nd and other components accordingly; V, V, … - volume of each component in a given amount of scale (also without considering the pores); ψ, ψ, …- volume fractions of each component:  On this basis, the true density of oxide scale can be calculated by the formula:          (41) where the symbol ρ with an index denotes the density of the corresponding component (xO means the oxide of the alloying element), and ψ with an index denotes its fraction in the "pure" (i.e. without considering the pores) volume of the scale, thus:        (42) As an example, Fig. 6 shows graphs of ρ, calculated by the formula (41) for four hypothetical compositions of oxide scale according to Table 8-9. From the graphs we can see that the range of possible changes in the true density of oxide scale is approximately from 5200 to 5600 kg·m depending on the temperature and the percentage composition of components. It is noteworthy that in the case of eutectoid decomposition of wüstite (composition No. 4) the local minimum of scale density may be observed in the vicinity of Chaudron point (basic value of 570 °С), but not at the maximum temperature.  density of its structural components at the basic values of critical temperatures. Numbers at the curves are the numbers of scale compositions according to Tables 8-9.  Table 8.

Temperature dependences of the mean coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CLTE) of the main components of oxide scale (wüstite FeO, magnetite FeO, hematite FeO and metallic iron) were obtained by integrating the previously proposed [1] functions of the true CLTE. The entire range from 0 °C to 1300 °C is divided into intervals by critical temperatures, which are considered the points of magnetic transitions, polymorphic transformation (for Fe) and thermodynamic stability boundary (for FeO). In general form, these critical temperatures enter the formulas as varying parameters. In particular form the formulas correspond to the basic values of critical temperatures.  The obtained formulas for the mean CLTE are used to estimate the density dependence on temperature for each component of the oxide scale. For magnetite, the Curie temperature variation in the 550-627ºC range can lead to density changes of the order of 10 kg·m in the vicinity of this interval, whereas for wüstite and hematite the possible shift in magnetic transition temperature has almost no effect on their density. For iron, the Curie point shift also has virtually no effect on its density at a particular temperature, but the mobility of the polymorphic (α ↔ γ) transformation may be led to a change in density at a fixed temperature by up to 75 kg·m due to a jump change in the crystal lattice parameters.  To calculate the true density of oxide scale as a whole, the sum of the products of the density of its components on their volume fractions used. Calculation examples show that when cooling the steel product in the technological process, the range of possible changes in the true (excluding pores) density of scale is approximately from 5200 to 5600 kg·m, with a local minimum may be observed in the region of 570 ° C due to eutectoid decay of wüstite to magnetite and free iron. The resulting formulas are recommended for use in mathematical simulation of the production and processing of steel products in the presence of surface scale.
